# Music Practice Tracker

A comprehensive Android application for tracking music practice activities, performances, and progress. Built with modern Android development practices using Kotlin and AndroidX libraries.

**Current Version**: 1.0.7.4 (Development) - *Not yet released on Google Play Store*

**AI-Assisted Development**: This project was developed collaboratively with Claude Opus (initial development), Claude Sonnet (bug fixes & refinements), ChatGPT and Cursor (design consultation).

> **Project Origins**: See [`app/docs/initial-prompt.md`](app/docs/initial-prompt.md) for the original project requirements and design concepts that guided this application's development.

## Known Issues & Planned Features

⚠️ **Known Issue**: Calendar month swiping is partially disabled but may still work inconsistently. Month navigation should only use Previous/Next buttons. See Bug #1 in [`app/docs/bugs.md`](app/docs/bugs.md) for details.

🚧 **Planned Feature**: Google Drive sync integration for seamless data backup and synchronization across devices.
