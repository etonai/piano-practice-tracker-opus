# Development Cycle 2025-0013

**Status:** Open  
**Start Date:** 2025-08-05  
**Focus:** Testing Build 1.0.8.28-beta

## Overview

## Current Work Items

### Phase 1: Test Build 1.0.8.28-beta with Analytics Implementation
**Status:** ðŸŽ« Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-05  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** Conduct comprehensive testing of build 1.0.8.28-beta to validate complete analytics implementation and ensure readiness for production release. This build includes all analytics enhancements from DevCycle 2025-0012 plus all previous DevCycle implementations.
**Build Version:** 1.0.8.28-beta

**Testing Focus Areas:**
- Complete Firebase Analytics implementation validation across all user flows
- Real-world analytics data collection and Firebase Console monitoring
- Source context tracking verification (main_flow, dashboard_quick, calendar_quick, suggestion)
- Streak achievement tracking at all milestone levels (3, 5, 8, 14, 21, 30, 50, 100 days)
- Piece addition context tracking (pieces_tab vs during_activity_creation)
- JSON import/export operation analytics with success/failure monitoring
- Data pruning operation tracking with accurate deletion counts
- Analytics performance impact assessment on app responsiveness
- Cross-device analytics consistency testing

- [ ] Test analytics in airplane mode / offline scenarios
- [ ] Confirm analytics batch upload when connectivity restored

### Phase 2: Fix Practice Suggestions Favorites Discrepancy  
**Status:** ðŸŽ« Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-11  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Investigate and resolve the discrepancy between practice suggestions displayed for favorites in the dashboard (2 suggestions shown) versus the suggestions tab (only 1 suggestion listed). The issue appears to be related to differences in how performances versus practices are tracked for favorite pieces.

**Technical Analysis Needed:**
- Compare dashboard favorite practice suggestion logic with suggestions tab logic
- Investigate performance vs practice tracking differences for favorite pieces
- Identify why suggestion counts differ between UI contexts
- Determine root cause of data inconsistency

**Expected Resolution:**
- Consistent practice suggestion counts across dashboard and suggestions tab
- Unified logic for handling favorite piece suggestions
- Clear differentiation between performance and practice tracking if intentional

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Investigate current implementation of dashboard favorite practice suggestions
- [ ] Investigate current implementation of suggestions tab favorite listings  
- [ ] Identify root cause of the 2 vs 1 suggestion discrepancy
- [ ] Determine if issue is related to performance vs practice tracking differences
- [ ] Implement fix to ensure consistent favorite practice suggestion counts
- [ ] Test fix across both dashboard and suggestions tab contexts
- [ ] Verify no regression in existing suggestion functionality

### Phase 3: Fix Performance Suggestions Favorites Ordering  
**Status:** ðŸŽ« Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-11  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Fix the ordering of performance suggestions where favorites and non-favorites are currently mixed together. The performance suggestions list should display all favorites first, followed by all non-favorites. The issue affects both dashboard and suggestions tab (correctly showing the same mixed list in both locations).

**Current Issue:**
- Performance suggestions mix favorites and non-favorites randomly in the list
- Expected behavior: All favorite pieces should appear at the top, followed by non-favorites
- Both dashboard and suggestions tab show the same (incorrectly ordered) list

**Technical Analysis Needed:**
- Locate performance suggestions generation logic
- Identify current sorting/ordering implementation
- Implement proper sorting: favorites first, then non-favorites
- Maintain any existing secondary sorting (e.g., by date, frequency, etc.)

**Expected Resolution:**
- Performance suggestions consistently ordered with favorites at the top
- Proper prioritization of favorite pieces in suggestion algorithms
- Maintained functionality across both dashboard and suggestions tab

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Investigate current performance suggestions ordering implementation
- [ ] Identify where performance suggestions list is generated/sorted
- [ ] Implement sorting logic to prioritize favorites over non-favorites
- [ ] Maintain any existing secondary sorting criteria within each group
- [ ] Test performance suggestions ordering in dashboard context
- [ ] Test performance suggestions ordering in suggestions tab context
- [ ] Verify favorites consistently appear before non-favorites in both locations
- [ ] Ensure no regression in suggestion algorithm quality or relevance

### Phase 4: Implement Streak Milestone Analytics Deduplication  
**Status:** ðŸŽ« Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-11  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Implement deduplication logic for `streak_achieved` analytics events to ensure they are only sent once per day when a user hits a playstreak milestone. Currently, if a user hits a streak milestone and uses the app multiple times in the same day, the analytics event may be sent multiple times, creating duplicate entries in Firebase Analytics.

**Current Issue:**
- `streak_achieved` events may be sent multiple times per day for the same milestone
- Analytics data becomes inflated with duplicate milestone events
- Firebase Analytics shows inaccurate streak achievement frequency

**Technical Requirements:**
- Track when `streak_achieved` events have been sent for each milestone on each day
- Only send `streak_achieved` event on first dashboard load after hitting milestone that day
- Maintain existing milestone detection logic (3, 5, 8, 14, 21, 30, 50, 100 days)
- Preserve existing emoji level mapping for streak milestones
- Store deduplication state locally (SharedPreferences or similar)

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Add daily tracking mechanism for sent streak events
- Check if milestone event already sent for current date before sending
- Clear/reset tracking data appropriately (daily cleanup)
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing streak tracking

**Expected Resolution:**
- Each `streak_achieved` event sent exactly once per milestone per day
- Accurate analytics data for streak milestone achievements
- No duplicate events in Firebase Analytics for same-day milestone hits

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Investigate current `streak_achieved` event triggering implementation
- [ ] Design deduplication mechanism using daily tracking
- [ ] Implement local storage for tracking sent events per day
- [ ] Add logic to check if milestone event already sent today
- [ ] Modify dashboard load logic to respect deduplication rules
- [ ] Test milestone event deduplication across multiple app launches same day
- [ ] Verify events still sent correctly on different days for same milestone
- [ ] Test edge cases: app restart, date changes, milestone progression
- [ ] Validate Firebase Analytics shows only one event per milestone per day
- [ ] Ensure existing milestone detection and emoji levels remain functional
- [ ] Test deduplication works correctly for all milestone levels (3, 5, 8, 14, 21, 30, 50, 100)
