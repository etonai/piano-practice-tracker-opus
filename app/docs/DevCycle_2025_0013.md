# Development Cycle 2025-0013

**Status:** Open  
**Start Date:** 2025-08-05  
**Focus:** Testing Build 1.0.8.28-beta

## Overview

This development cycle focuses on comprehensive testing of build 1.0.8.28-beta, which includes all the enhanced analytics implementation from DevCycle 2025-0012. The cycle validates the complete Firebase Analytics tracking system, ensures all analytics events are working correctly in production scenarios, and verifies overall application stability with the new analytics infrastructure.

## Current Work Items

### Phase 1: Test Build 1.0.8.28-beta with Analytics Implementation
**Status:** ðŸŽ« Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-05  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** Conduct comprehensive testing of build 1.0.8.28-beta to validate complete analytics implementation and ensure readiness for production release. This build includes all analytics enhancements from DevCycle 2025-0012 plus all previous DevCycle implementations.
**Build Version:** 1.0.8.28-beta

**Testing Focus Areas:**
- Complete Firebase Analytics implementation validation across all user flows
- Real-world analytics data collection and Firebase Console monitoring
- Source context tracking verification (main_flow, dashboard_quick, calendar_quick, suggestion)
- Streak achievement tracking at all milestone levels (3, 5, 8, 14, 21, 30, 50, 100 days)
- Piece addition context tracking (pieces_tab vs during_activity_creation)
- JSON import/export operation analytics with success/failure monitoring
- Data pruning operation tracking with accurate deletion counts
- Analytics performance impact assessment on app responsiveness
- Cross-device analytics consistency testing
- All previous functionality from DevCycle 2025-0011 and earlier implementations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Complete testing of build 1.0.8.28-beta functionality
- [ ] Verify all 5 analytics event types work correctly in production scenarios:
  - [ ] `activity_logged` events appear with correct source parameters
  - [ ] `streak_achieved` events trigger at proper milestones with accurate emoji levels
  - [ ] `piece_added` events track with correct context (pieces_tab vs during_activity_creation)
  - [ ] `data_operation` events track JSON import/export with success/failure status
  - [ ] `data_pruning` events track deletion operations with accurate counts
- [ ] Verify Firebase Console shows accurate analytics data within expected timeframes
- [ ] Test analytics across multiple user scenarios and usage patterns
- [ ] Confirm analytics data provides meaningful business insights
- [ ] Verify no performance degradation from analytics implementation
- [ ] Test analytics work correctly on different Android versions and devices
- [ ] Validate privacy compliance - no PII tracked in analytics events
- [ ] Confirm all existing app functionality continues to work correctly
- [ ] Verify Dashboard Week Summary enhancements remain functional
- [ ] Verify duplicate piece name validation continues to work across both entry points
- [ ] Test application stability with analytics system under various usage scenarios
- [ ] Document any issues or performance impacts discovered during testing
- [ ] Verify application meets quality standards for production release with analytics

**Analytics Validation Requirements:**
- [ ] Real-time event verification via Firebase DebugView
- [ ] Production analytics data validation in Firebase Console Events tab
- [ ] Cross-reference analytics data with user actions for accuracy
- [ ] Validate parameter values match specifications exactly
- [ ] Test error scenarios - failed imports, validation failures, pruning with no data
- [ ] Verify analytics continue working after app restart, device reboot
- [ ] Test analytics in airplane mode / offline scenarios
- [ ] Confirm analytics batch upload when connectivity restored

## Cycle Notes

- This cycle builds upon the completed DevCycle 2025-0012 analytics implementation
- Focus is on production validation of the comprehensive analytics system
- All 5 analytics event types implemented and require thorough real-world testing
- Analytics provide critical business intelligence for user behavior, feature adoption, and retention
- Success criteria: build 1.0.8.28-beta passes all testing phases without critical analytics or functionality issues
- Upon successful testing, proceed to DevCycle 2025-0014 for production release preparation
