### Phase 2: Fix Practice Suggestions Favorites Discrepancy  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-11  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Investigate and resolve the discrepancy between practice suggestions displayed for favorites in the dashboard (2 suggestions shown) versus the suggestions tab (only 1 suggestion listed). The issue appears to be related to differences in how performances versus practices are tracked for favorite pieces.

**Root Cause Analysis (CONFIRMED):**
- **Dashboard** uses `generateAllSuggestions()` which combines both practice AND performance suggestions into one list
- **Suggestions Tab** uses separate `generatePracticeSuggestions()` and `generatePerformanceSuggestions()` methods, keeping them in separate sections
- **Duplicate Issue**: In Pro mode, the same favorite piece can qualify for both practice and performance suggestions simultaneously (e.g., hasn't been practiced in 2+ days AND has recent practices but no recent performance)
- **Result**: Dashboard shows the same favorite piece twice (once for practice, once for performance) while suggestions tab shows it once in each separate section

**Technical Analysis:**
- Dashboard: `DashboardViewModel.kt:116` calls `suggestionsService.generateAllSuggestions(pieces, activities)`
- Suggestions Tab: `SuggestionsViewModel.kt:38` calls `suggestionsService.generatePracticeSuggestions(pieces, activities)` and separately displays performance suggestions
- The `generateAllSuggestions()` method needs deduplication logic to prevent same piece appearing multiple times

**Expected Resolution:**
- Dashboard suggestions work the same way as suggestions tab (separate practice and performance sections, no duplicates)
- Maintain existing functionality while eliminating duplicate favorite pieces
- Consistent user experience between dashboard and suggestions tab

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Investigate current implementation of dashboard favorite practice suggestions
- [x] Investigate current implementation of suggestions tab favorite listings  
- [x] Identify root cause of the 2 vs 1 suggestion discrepancy (duplicate pieces in combined list)
- [x] Determine if issue is related to performance vs practice tracking differences (confirmed: same piece appears twice)
- [x] Confirm dashboard uses `generateAllSuggestions()` while suggestions tab uses separate methods
- [x] Modify dashboard to use separate practice and performance suggestion sections like suggestions tab
- [x] Implement separate display of practice and performance suggestions in dashboard (UI already existed)
- [x] Test fix eliminates duplicate favorite pieces in Pro mode
- [x] Verify dashboard matches suggestions tab behavior (separate sections, no duplicates)
- [x] Verify no regression in existing suggestion functionality

### Phase 3: Fix Performance Suggestions Favorites Ordering  
**Status:** ðŸŽ« Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-11  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Fix the ordering of performance suggestions where favorites and non-favorites are currently mixed together. The performance suggestions list should display all favorites first, followed by all non-favorites. The issue affects both dashboard and suggestions tab (correctly showing the same mixed list in both locations).

**Current Issue:**
- Performance suggestions mix favorites and non-favorites randomly in the list
- Expected behavior: All favorite pieces should appear at the top, followed by non-favorites
- Both dashboard and suggestions tab show the same (incorrectly ordered) list

**Technical Analysis Needed:**
- Locate performance suggestions generation logic
- Identify current sorting/ordering implementation
- Implement proper sorting: favorites first, then non-favorites
- Maintain any existing secondary sorting (e.g., by date, frequency, etc.)

**Expected Resolution:**
- Performance suggestions consistently ordered with favorites at the top
- Proper prioritization of favorite pieces in suggestion algorithms
- Maintained functionality across both dashboard and suggestions tab

**Technical Analysis:**
- [x] Investigate current performance suggestions ordering implementation
- [x] Identify where performance suggestions list is generated/sorted (SuggestionsService.kt:194-214)
- [x] Identify that performance suggestions have only total limit (5) vs practice suggestions with separate favorite/non-favorite limits
- [x] Simple favorites-first sorting attempted but reverted due to unbalanced results (4 favorites + 1 non-favorite)

**Strategy Decision Needed:**
- [ ] Determine desired performance suggestions strategy:
  - Option A: Simple reordering - favorites first within existing 5 total limit
  - Option B: Separate favorite/non-favorite limits (like practice suggestions)
  - Option C: Balanced approach (e.g., max 3 favorites, ensure some non-favorites)

**Implementation (Pending Strategy Decision):**
- [ ] Implement chosen performance suggestions ordering strategy
- [ ] Test performance suggestions ordering in dashboard context
- [ ] Test performance suggestions ordering in suggestions tab context
- [ ] Verify strategy produces desired favorite/non-favorite balance
- [ ] Ensure no regression in suggestion algorithm quality or relevance

### Phase 4: Implement Streak Milestone Analytics Deduplication  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-11  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Implement deduplication logic for `streak_achieved` analytics events to ensure they are only sent once per day when a user hits a playstreak milestone. Currently, if a user hits a streak milestone and uses the app multiple times in the same day, the analytics event may be sent multiple times, creating duplicate entries in Firebase Analytics.

**Current Issue:**
- `streak_achieved` events may be sent multiple times per day for the same milestone
- Analytics data becomes inflated with duplicate milestone events
- Firebase Analytics shows inaccurate streak achievement frequency

**Technical Requirements:**
- Track when `streak_achieved` events have been sent for each milestone on each day
- Only send `streak_achieved` event on first dashboard load after hitting milestone that day
- Maintain existing milestone detection logic (3, 5, 8, 14, 21, 30, 50, 100 days)
- Preserve existing emoji level mapping for streak milestones
- Store deduplication state locally (SharedPreferences or similar)

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Add daily tracking mechanism for sent streak events
- Check if milestone event already sent for current date before sending
- Clear/reset tracking data appropriately (daily cleanup)
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing streak tracking

**Expected Resolution:**
- Each `streak_achieved` event sent exactly once per milestone per day
- Accurate analytics data for streak milestone achievements
- No duplicate events in Firebase Analytics for same-day milestone hits

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Investigate current `streak_achieved` event triggering implementation
- [x] Design deduplication mechanism using daily tracking
- [x] Implement local storage for tracking sent events per day (SharedPreferences)
- [x] Add logic to check if milestone event already sent today
- [x] Implement deduplication in `AnalyticsManager.trackStreakAchieved()` method
- [x] Add cleanup mechanism to prevent SharedPreferences bloat (7-day retention)
- [x] Test milestone event deduplication across multiple app launches same day
- [x] Verify events still sent correctly on different days for same milestone
- [x] Test edge cases: app restart, date changes, milestone progression
- [x] Validate Firebase Analytics shows only one event per milestone per day
- [x] Ensure existing milestone detection and emoji levels remain functional
- [x] Test deduplication works correctly for all authorized milestone levels (3, 5, 8, 14)

### Phase 5: Remove Unauthorized Streak Milestones Above 14 Days  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-11  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Remove unauthorized streak milestone tracking for levels above 14 days (21, 30, 50, 100). The analytics system is currently tracking milestones that were not approved and exceed the designed emoji progression system which only goes up to 14+ days (ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥).

**Current Issue:**
- Analytics tracking includes milestones: `3, 5, 8, 14, 21, 30, 50, 100` days
- Authorized milestones should only be: `3, 5, 8, 14` days (matching emoji progression)
- Unauthorized milestones `21, 30, 50, 100` were implemented without approval
- Emoji system only supports up to 14+ days (ðŸŽµ â†’ ðŸŽ¶ â†’ ðŸ”¥ â†’ ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥)

**Files to Modify:**
- `AddActivityViewModel.kt` - Remove unauthorized milestones from tracking list
- `QuickAddActivityViewModel.kt` - Remove unauthorized milestones from tracking list
- Analytics comments and documentation referring to unauthorized milestones

**Technical Requirements:**
- Change milestone list from `listOf(3, 5, 8, 14, 21, 30, 50, 100)` to `listOf(3, 5, 8, 14)`
- Maintain existing emoji level mapping for authorized milestones (3-4: ðŸŽµ, 5-7: ðŸŽ¶, 8-13: ðŸ”¥, 14+: ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥)
- Ensure no `streak_achieved` events are sent for milestones above 14 days
- Update any documentation or comments referencing the unauthorized milestones

**Expected Resolution:**
- Streak milestone analytics limited to approved levels: 3, 5, 8, 14 days only
- No analytics events generated for unauthorized milestones above 14 days
- System aligned with designed emoji progression limits

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Identify all locations where milestone list `listOf(3, 5, 8, 14, 21, 30, 50, 100)` is used
- [x] Remove unauthorized milestones (21, 30, 50, 100) from tracking lists
- [x] Update milestone list to `listOf(3, 5, 8, 14)` in all relevant files
- [x] Update comments to reference "aligned with emoji progression system"
- [x] Verify no `streak_achieved` events are sent for milestones above 14 days
- [x] Test that authorized milestones (3, 5, 8, 14) still work correctly
- [x] Verify emoji level mapping remains correct for authorized milestones only
