### Phase 2: Update Target API Level for Google Play Compliance
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-31  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** Update the app's target API level to meet Google Play requirements before the Aug 31, 2025 deadline. Google has detected that PlayStreak is targeting an old version of Android and requires all apps to meet current target API level requirements for security and user safety.

**Current Status:**
- Target SDK: 36 (successfully updated with UI compatibility fixes)
- Google Play compliance deadline: Aug 31, 2025
- App name referenced in Google notification: PlayStreak
- Google Play Console Issue: https://play.google.com/console/u/0/developers/7182365112407544306/app/4976114423720835461/policy-center/issues/4986177253656722641/details

- App functionality fully compatible with API 36
- No breaking changes introduced by API level update

**Technical Requirements:**
- Verify current targetSdk configuration in app/build.gradle.kts
- Ensure all dependencies are compatible with target API level 36
- Test app functionality on target API level
- Address any deprecated API usage or behavioral changes
- Validate Google Play Console submission requirements

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Update compileSdk to API level 36 if not already set
- [x] Review and update any deprecated API usage
- [x] Implement proper edge-to-edge display handling
- [x] Test app functionality on Android devices running API level 36
- [x] Verify no breaking changes introduced by target API update
- [x] Test app installation and basic functionality
- [x] Prepare for Google Play Console submission
- [x] Document any API migration changes required
- [x] Ensure compliance with Google Play target API requirements

### Phase 3: Fix Missing Performance Suggestions in Suggestions Tab
**Status:** üé´ Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-31  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** In the production version of PlayStreak, performance suggestions are not appearing in the Suggestions tab, although they are correctly displayed in the Dashboard. This suggests a data filtering or display logic issue specific to the Suggestions tab implementation.

**Issue Details:**
- Performance suggestions visible in Dashboard ‚úÖ
- Performance suggestions missing from Suggestions tab ‚ùå
- Only affects the production/pro version of the app
- Suggests a conditional logic or data source problem in Suggestions tab

**Investigation Areas:**
- Compare Dashboard vs Suggestions tab data fetching logic
- Check if performance suggestions are being filtered out in Suggestions tab
- Verify database queries and data transformations
- Review any version-specific or premium feature logic
- Test in both debug and release builds to isolate the issue

**Root Cause Analysis:**
After investigating the codebase, the issue has been identified:

**Dashboard Implementation (WORKING CORRECTLY):**
- `DashboardFragment.kt:116-139` observes `viewModel.performanceSuggestions`
- `DashboardViewModel.kt:104-109` calls `suggestionsService.generatePerformanceSuggestions()`
- Performance suggestions are displayed in a separate card (`performanceSuggestionsCard`)

**Suggestions Tab Implementation (BUG IDENTIFIED):**
- `SuggestionsFragment.kt:72-75` **EXPLICITLY HIDES** performance suggestions:
  ```kotlin
  // Hide performance suggestions section completely (no Pro features)
  binding.performanceSuggestionsHeader.visibility = View.GONE
  binding.performanceRecyclerView.visibility = View.GONE
  binding.noPerformanceSuggestionsText.visibility = View.GONE
  ```
- `SuggestionsFragment.kt:58-63` **FILTERS OUT** performance suggestions:
  ```kotlin
  // Only show practice suggestions (no Pro features)
  val practiceSuggestions = suggestions.filter { it.suggestionType == SuggestionType.PRACTICE }
  ```

**Technical Details:**
- `SuggestionsService.generatePerformanceSuggestions()` correctly returns performance suggestions for Pro users
- `ProUserManager.isProUser()` determines Pro status via SharedPreferences
- Dashboard correctly displays performance suggestions for Pro users
- Suggestions tab has hardcoded logic to hide performance suggestions with comment "no Pro features"

**Impact:**
- Pro users see performance suggestions in Dashboard ‚úÖ
- Pro users cannot see performance suggestions in Suggestions tab ‚ùå
- This creates inconsistent user experience between the two screens

**Proposed Solution:**
1. **Remove hardcoded filtering** in `SuggestionsFragment.kt:60` - change from filtering only practice suggestions to showing all suggestions for Pro users
2. **Add Pro user conditional logic** for performance suggestions UI visibility (similar to Dashboard implementation)
3. **Create performance suggestions adapter** and RecyclerView setup for Suggestions tab
4. **Maintain free user experience** - continue hiding performance suggestions for non-Pro users

**Implementation Files to Modify:**
- `SuggestionsFragment.kt` - Remove hardcoded performance suggestions filtering and hiding
- `SuggestionsViewModel.kt` - May need to add separate performance suggestions LiveData
- `fragment_suggestions.xml` - Ensure performance suggestions UI elements exist
- Testing required in both Pro and Free user modes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Investigate Suggestions tab data source and filtering logic
- [x] Compare Dashboard performance suggestions implementation  
- [x] Identify root cause of missing performance suggestions
- [ ] Implement fix to display performance suggestions in Suggestions tab
- [ ] Verify performance suggestions appear in both Dashboard and Suggestions tab
- [ ] Test fix in both debug and production builds
- [ ] Ensure no regression in existing suggestions functionality
- [ ] Document the root cause and solution implemented
