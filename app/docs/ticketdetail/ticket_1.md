# Ticket #1: Expand Firebase Analytics Event Types

**Status:** Open  
**Date Created:** 2025-07-23  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Requested By:** Product Team

## Description
Expand the current Firebase Analytics implementation to track additional event types beyond the basic `activity_logged` event. This will provide deeper insights into user behavior and app usage patterns to guide future development decisions.

## Current Implementation
The app currently tracks:
- `activity_logged` - When users log practice or performance activities

## Proposed Additional Events
This ticket requires ideation about which events merit tracking. Consider events such as:

### User Engagement Events
- App launch and session duration
- Tab switching behavior (Dashboard, Calendar, Pieces, etc.)
- Feature usage frequency (CSV import/export, suggestions usage)

### Content Management Events
- Piece/technique creation (`piece_added`)
- Piece favoriting/unfavoriting 
- Piece deletion or archiving

### Data Management Events
- CSV import operations (`csv_imported`)
- CSV export operations (`csv_exported`)
- Data backup and sync events

### Performance Tracking Events
- Streak achievements (`streak_achieved`)
- Milestone completions (e.g., 100th activity, 1-year anniversary)
- Practice goal completions

### User Behavior Events
- Suggestion interactions (suggestion tapped, ignored)
- Timeline interactions (edit, delete activities)
- Calendar navigation patterns

### Feature Adoption Events
- First use of new features
- Pro feature usage (when implemented)
- Settings changes and preferences

## Technical Considerations
- Follow Firebase Analytics best practices for event naming
- Implement proper parameter structure for each event type
- Consider privacy implications and user consent requirements
- Ensure events provide actionable insights for product development
- Balance data collection with app performance
- Plan for A/B testing capabilities if needed

## Implementation Requirements
- Extend AnalyticsManager.kt with new event tracking methods
- Add appropriate event tracking calls throughout the app
- Update privacy documentation if required
- Create dashboard/reporting strategy for analyzing collected data
- Consider implementing custom conversion events for key user actions

## Success Criteria
- Comprehensive event tracking strategy documented and approved
- All identified events properly implemented and tested
- Analytics data successfully flowing to Firebase Console
- Product team can make data-driven decisions based on collected insights

## Dependencies
- Requires completion of Feature #36 (Firebase Analytics basic implementation) âœ…
- May require user consent/privacy policy updates
- Consider integration with future pro/free tier analytics needs
