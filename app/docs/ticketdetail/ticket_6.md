**Status:** ðŸŽ« Open  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Date Created:** 2025-07-26  

## Description

Update the practice level descriptions to improve clarity and provide a better progression from incomplete to complete practice sessions.

## Current Practice Levels

- Level 1 - Essentials
- Level 2 - Incomplete  
- Level 3 - Complete with Review
- Level 4 - Perfect Complete

## Proposed Changes

- Level 1 - Essentials (no change)
- Level 2 - Incomplete (no change)
- Level 3 - **Complete with Issues** (changed from "Complete with Review")
- Level 4 - **Complete and Satisfactory** (changed from "Perfect Complete")

## Implementation Details

### Files to Update

1. **Primary change:**
   - `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` - Update string resources for practice levels

2. **Files that may reference these levels:**
   - Various UI components and ViewModels that display practice level text
   - Documentation files that describe the practice levels

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Update `practice_level_3` string resource to "Level 3 - Complete with Issues"
- [ ] Update `practice_level_4` string resource to "Level 4 - Complete and Satisfactory"  
- [ ] Verify changes appear correctly in the UI where practice levels are displayed
- [ ] Update any documentation that references the old level descriptions
- [ ] Test that the changes don't affect the underlying logic for practice level tracking

## Technical Notes

This is primarily a string resource change that should not affect the underlying functionality of practice level tracking or scoring. The change is cosmetic but improves user understanding of what each level represents.

## Impact

- **User Experience:** Clearer understanding of practice level meanings
- **Code Impact:** Minimal - primarily string resource changes
- **Testing Required:** UI verification to ensure text displays correctly
