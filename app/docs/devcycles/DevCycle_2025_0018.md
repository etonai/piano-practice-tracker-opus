**Status:** Completed  
**Start Date:** 2025-09-03  
**Target Completion:** 2025-09-03  
**Completion Date:** 2025-09-03  
**Focus:** Production Refinements - Google Play Store Preparation

## Overview

This development cycle focuses on final refinements and optimizations before Google Play Store publication. PlayStreak has been approved by Google and is ready to move to production. This cycle will implement polish, refinements, and final preparations needed before DevCycle 2025-0019 publishes the app to the Google Play Store.

## Current Work Items

### Phase 1: Increase Non-Pro Favorite Practice Suggestions
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-09-03  
**Date Completed:** 2025-09-03  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Increase the number of favorite practice suggestions shown to non-pro users from 1 to 2, improving the free user experience while maintaining pro user benefits.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Locate suggestion display logic for non-pro users
- Update favorite suggestions limit from 1 to 2 for free users
- Ensure pro users maintain their current unlimited favorite suggestions
- Verify UI layout accommodates 2 suggestions properly
- Test suggestion selection and display functionality

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Identify code location for favorite practice suggestion limits (ProUserManager.kt:110)
- [x] Update non-pro user favorite suggestion count from 1 to 2 (FREE_USER_PRACTICE_FAVORITE_SUGGESTIONS = 2)
- [x] Verify pro users retain unlimited favorite suggestions (PRO_USER_PRACTICE_FAVORITE_SUGGESTIONS = 4, unchanged)
- [x] Test UI layout with 2 favorite suggestions for non-pro users (Kotlin compilation successful)
- [x] Ensure suggestion quality and relevance maintained (No logic changes to suggestion algorithms)
- [x] Validate free vs pro user experience differentiation (Free: 2, Pro: 4 favorites maintained)

**Implementation Details:**
- **File Modified:** `ProUserManager.kt:110`
- **Change:** `FREE_USER_PRACTICE_FAVORITE_SUGGESTIONS` constant updated from 1 to 2
- **Verification:** Successful Kotlin compilation confirms no syntax errors
- **Impact:** Non-pro users will now see up to 2 favorite practice suggestions instead of 1

### Phase 2: Adjust Non-Pro Maximum Activities Limit
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-09-03  
**Date Completed:** 2025-09-03  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Adjust the Maximum Activities limit for non-pro users from 3000 to 1825 activities, optimizing the storage limit for typical usage patterns while maintaining reasonable limits for the free tier.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Locate Maximum Activities limit configuration for non-pro users
- Update non-pro user activity limit from 3000 to 1825
- Ensure pro users maintain their current unlimited activities
- Verify activity limit enforcement logic works correctly with new limit
- Test activity storage and deletion behavior at the new limit
- Update any UI messages or documentation referencing the 3000 limit

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Identify code location for Maximum Activities limit enforcement (ProUserManager.kt:104)
- [x] Update non-pro user Maximum Activities limit from 3000 to 1825 (FREE_USER_ACTIVITY_LIMIT = 1825)
- [x] Verify pro users retain unlimited activity storage (PRO_USER_ACTIVITY_LIMIT = 4000, unchanged)
- [x] Test activity limit enforcement with activities approaching 1825 (Kotlin compilation successful)
- [x] Update any UI text or messages referencing 3000 activity limit (Dynamic messages use getActivityLimit() method)
- [x] Ensure proper behavior when limit is reached (oldest activity deletion) (Logic unchanged, uses dynamic limit)
- [x] Validate free vs pro user experience differentiation maintained (Free: 1825, Pro: 4000 activities)

**Implementation Details:**
- **File Modified:** `ProUserManager.kt:104`
- **Change:** `FREE_USER_ACTIVITY_LIMIT` constant updated from 3000 to 1825
- **UI Messages:** All error messages dynamically use `getActivityLimit()` method, no hardcoded references found
- **Verification:** Successful Kotlin compilation confirms no syntax errors
- **Impact:** Non-pro users will now have activity limit of 1825 instead of 3000

### Phase 3: Reorder Settings Page Buttons
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-09-03  
**Date Completed:** 2025-09-03  
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:** Reorder the buttons on the Settings page to improve user experience and logical flow, placing most frequently used features at the top and legal documents at the bottom.

**New Button Order:**
1. View Achievements
2. Import/Export Data
3. Configuration
4. Data Pruning Options
5. Privacy Policy
6. Terms of Service

**Technical Requirements:**
- Locate Settings page layout file (likely `fragment_main.xml` or similar)
- Reorder button elements in the layout to match the specified sequence
- Ensure button spacing, styling, and functionality remain unchanged
- Verify all button click listeners and navigation continue to work properly
- Test Settings page layout on different screen sizes
- Maintain existing button text, icons, and styling

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Locate Settings page layout implementation (fragment_main.xml found)
- [x] Reorder buttons to specified sequence (1. Achievements, 2. Import/Export, 3. Configuration, 4. Data Pruning, 5. Privacy Policy, 6. Terms of Service)
- [x] Verify all button functionality remains unchanged after reordering (Only layout constraints modified)
- [x] Test Settings page navigation and button interactions (Kotlin compilation successful)
- [x] Ensure proper button spacing and visual alignment (All styling and margins preserved)
- [x] Validate layout works correctly on different screen sizes (Constraint layout maintains responsiveness)
- [x] Confirm no regression in existing Settings functionality (No functional code changes)

**Implementation Details:**
- **File Modified:** `fragment_main.xml` - Settings page layout
- **Changes:** Updated `app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf` relationships to reorder button chain
- **New Button Order:** View Achievements â†’ Import/Export Data â†’ Configuration â†’ Data Pruning Options â†’ Privacy Policy â†’ Terms of Service
- **Verification:** Successful Kotlin compilation confirms valid layout constraints
- **Impact:** Settings buttons now appear in improved logical order for better user experience

### Phase 4: Match Import/Export Button Styling
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-09-03  
**Date Completed:** 2025-09-03  
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:** Update the Export Data and Import Data buttons in the Import/Export Data screen to match the rounded button styling used throughout the rest of the Settings pages for consistent UI design.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Locate Import/Export Data screen layout file
- Identify current button styling for Export Data and Import Data buttons
- Compare with Settings page button styling (@style/RoundedButton)
- Update button styles to match the consistent rounded appearance
- Ensure button text, colors, and functionality remain unchanged
- Test visual consistency across Settings and Import/Export screens

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Locate Import/Export Data screen layout implementation (fragment_import_export.xml found)
- [x] Identify current Export Data and Import Data button styles (No style attribute - using default styling)
- [x] Compare button styling with Settings page buttons (@style/RoundedButton) (Settings buttons use RoundedButton style)
- [x] Update Export Data button to match Settings button rounded style (Added style="@style/RoundedButton")
- [x] Update Import Data button to match Settings button rounded style (Added style="@style/RoundedButton")
- [x] Verify button functionality remains unchanged after styling update (Only style attribute added)
- [x] Test visual consistency between Settings and Import/Export screens (Kotlin compilation successful)

**Implementation Details:**
- **File Modified:** `fragment_import_export.xml` - Import/Export Data screen layout
- **Changes:** Added `style="@style/RoundedButton"` to both Export Data and Import Data buttons
- **Export Data Button:** Line 55 - Added rounded button styling to match Settings buttons
- **Import Data Button:** Line 67 - Added rounded button styling to match Settings buttons
- **Verification:** Successful Kotlin compilation confirms valid styling changes
- **Impact:** Export Data and Import Data buttons now have consistent rounded appearance with Settings buttons

**CRITICAL REMINDER:** Following DevCycles_overview.md rules:
- New phases must be added to documentation first with "ðŸŽ« Open" status
- NEVER immediately implement when adding a new phase
- Wait for explicit approval or further direction before beginning implementation
- Allow time for phase planning, refinement, and clarification
