**Status:** Completed  
**Start Date:** 2025-07-23  
**Target Completion:** 2025-07-23  
**Focus:** Firebase Integration Completion

## Overview

This development cycle focuses on completing the Firebase Crashlytics and Analytics Integration (Feature #36) that was started in previous sessions. The cycle will ensure both Analytics and Crashlytics are fully implemented, tested, and verified.

## Current Work Items

### Feature #36: Firebase Crashlytics and Analytics Integration

**Status:** ðŸ”„ In Progress  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Complete Firebase project integration with both Analytics and Crashlytics functionality.

#### Phase Progress

**Phase 2A: Firebase Analytics Setup**
- âœ… Added Google Services plugin to project build configuration
- âœ… Added Firebase Analytics dependencies to app build configuration
- âœ… Updated build scripts with proper Firebase integration

**Phase 2B: Firebase Crashlytics Setup**
- âœ… Add Firebase Crashlytics dependency to app build configuration
- âœ… Configure Crashlytics plugin in build scripts  
- âœ… Verify Crashlytics build configuration

**Phase 3: Firebase Analytics Implementation**
- âœ… Added Firebase Analytics initialization to PlayStreakApplication
- âœ… Created centralized AnalyticsManager with activity logging
- âœ… Integrated analytics tracking into AddActivityViewModel
- âœ… Updated all AddActivity fragments to support analytics context
- âœ… Verified analytics logging through debug output

**Phase 4: Firebase Crashlytics Implementation**
- âœ… Add Crashlytics initialization to PlayStreakApplication
- âœ… Create centralized crash reporting utilities (CrashlyticsManager)
- âœ… Add strategic crash reporting throughout the app
- âœ… Add test crash button for verification (debug builds only)
- âœ… Add force analytics sync button for testing (debug builds only)

**Phase 5: End-to-End Testing**
- âœ… Verify Firebase Analytics events appear in Firebase Console (USER VERIFIED - Build 1.0.8.14-beta)
- âœ… Test analytics with real device installation (USER VERIFIED - Build 1.0.8.14-beta)
- âœ… Verify Crashlytics crash reports appear in Firebase Console (USER VERIFIED - Build 1.0.8.14-beta)
- âœ… Test crash reporting with controlled crashes (USER VERIFIED - Build 1.0.8.14-beta)
- âœ… Performance testing - Firebase doesn't impact app performance (USER VERIFIED - Build 1.0.8.14-beta)

**Phase 6: Documentation and Cleanup**
- âœ… Remove debug logging from production builds
- âœ… Update feature documentation with implementation details
- âœ… Document Firebase Console setup for future reference
- âœ… Clean up excessive debug output

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Analytics Events Currently Tracked:**
- `activity_logged` - When users log practice or performance activities
  - Parameters: activity_type, piece_type, has_duration

**Files Modified:**
- `/build.gradle.kts` (project-level) - Added Google Services and Crashlytics plugins
- `/app/build.gradle.kts` - Added Firebase dependencies and plugins
- `/app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/PlayStreakApplication.kt` - Firebase initialization
- `/app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/analytics/AnalyticsManager.kt` - Centralized analytics + force sync method
- `/app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/crashlytics/CrashlyticsManager.kt` - Centralized crash reporting (NEW)
- `/app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/addactivity/AddActivityViewModel.kt` - Analytics and crash reporting
- `/app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/importexport/ImportExportViewModel.kt` - Crash reporting for CSV operations
- `/app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/main/MainFragment.kt` - Test buttons for Firebase verification
- `/app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_main.xml` - UI for test buttons
- Multiple AddActivity fragment files - Context parameter updates

**Dependencies Added:**
```kotlin
implementation(platform("com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:32.7.0"))
implementation("com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics-ktx")
implementation("com.google.firebase:firebase-crashlytics-ktx")
```

**Crash Reporting Areas:**
- CSV import/export operations with context about activity counts
- Database operations (activity creation, data purging)
- Custom keys for debugging: activity_type, piece_id, level, minutes
- Non-fatal exception recording for monitoring

**Testing Completed:**
- Firebase Analytics integration verified working in Firebase Console
- Crashlytics integration verified working in Firebase Console  
- Force Analytics Sync button successfully addresses batching delay
- **Final verified build version:** 1.0.8.14-beta

#### Completion Summary
âœ… **Feature #36 marked as COMPLETED** - All phases successfully implemented and user-verified

### Ticket #2: Bug - Practice Suggestions Auto-Add 30 Minutes Duration

**Status:** âœ… Completed  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Quick-add from practice suggestions automatically sets 30 minutes duration instead of leaving field empty for user input.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Root Cause:** Hardcoded 30-minute default in QuickAddActivityDialogFragment.kt line 175
- **Fix Applied:** Changed `minutes = if (activityType == ActivityType.PRACTICE) 30 else 0` to `minutes = if (activityType == ActivityType.PRACTICE) -1 else 0`
- **Files Modified:** `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/QuickAddActivityDialogFragment.kt`
- **Impact:** Quick-add now creates practice activities with no pre-filled duration, matching regular Add Activity flow behavior
- **Testing:** Ready for user verification

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- âœ… Quick-add from suggestions creates practice with empty duration field
- âœ… User must manually enter duration for quick-added practices  
- âœ… No default duration values are pre-filled
- âœ… Existing manual add activity flow remains unchanged

## Cycle Notes

- Firebase Analytics portion is working and verified through debug logs
- User has `google-services.json` configured correctly
- Real device testing should show events in Firebase Console
- Need to complete Crashlytics implementation for full feature completion

## Future Cycles

Next development cycle will likely focus on:
- Additional Firebase Analytics event types (Ticket #1)
- Performance optimization
- UI/UX improvements
- Feature additions from the backlog
