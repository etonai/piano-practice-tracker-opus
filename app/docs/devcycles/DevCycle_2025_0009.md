### Phase 2: Fix Lifetime Activities Count Bug on Piece Deletion
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-30  
**Date Completed:** 2025-07-30  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Fix bug where deleting a piece with associated activities correctly decreases the Stored Activities count but fails to decrease the Lifetime Activities count. When a piece is deleted, all its associated activities are also deleted, so the Lifetime Activities count should decrease by the number of deleted activities.

**Bug Analysis:**
- **User Report**: Deleting piece with activities reduces Stored Activities count but not Lifetime Activities count
- **Expected Behavior**: Both Stored Activities and Lifetime Activities counts should decrease by number of deleted activities
- **Current Behavior**: Only Stored Activities count decreases, Lifetime Activities count remains unchanged
- **Relationship to DevCycle 2025-0008 Phase 6**: Phase 6 fixed individual activity deletion, but piece deletion may use different code path

**Technical Context:**
- This appears related to DevCycle 2025-0008 Phase 6 which fixed lifetime counter for individual activity deletion
- Phase 6 added `decrementLifetimeActivityCount()` to `PianoRepository.deleteActivity()`
- Piece deletion likely uses `PianoRepository.deletePieceAndActivities()` which may not call the lifetime counter decrement
- The piece deletion flow deletes multiple activities at once and may bypass the individual activity deletion logic

**Root Cause Analysis:**

**Code Flow Analysis:**

**1. Piece Deletion Entry Point:**
- `PiecesViewModel.deletePiece()` calls `repository.deletePieceAndActivities(pieceId)` (PiecesViewModel.kt:167)

**2. Repository Implementation Analysis:**
```kotlin
// PianoRepository.kt lines 54-60
suspend fun deletePieceAndActivities(pieceId: Long) {
    // First delete all activities for this piece
    activityDao.deleteActivitiesForPiece(pieceId)        // ❌ BULK DELETE - NO LIFETIME COUNTER
    // Then delete the piece itself
    val piece = pieceOrTechniqueDao.getById(pieceId)
    piece?.let { pieceOrTechniqueDao.delete(it) }
}
```

**3. DAO Implementation Analysis:**
```kotlin  
// ActivityDao.kt line 40-41
@Query("DELETE FROM activities WHERE pieceOrTechniqueId = :pieceId")
suspend fun deleteActivitiesForPiece(pieceId: Long)     // ❌ BULK SQL DELETE - BYPASSES LIFETIME COUNTER
```

**4. Comparison with Individual Activity Deletion (Fixed in Phase 6):**
```kotlin
// PianoRepository.kt lines 115-123 (FIXED in DevCycle 2025-0008 Phase 6)
suspend fun deleteActivity(activity: Activity) {
    val pieceId = activity.pieceOrTechniqueId
    activityDao.delete(activity)                          // ✅ Single delete
    configurationManager.decrementLifetimeActivityCount(1) // ✅ DECREMENTS LIFETIME COUNTER
    updatePieceStatistics(pieceId)
}
```

**Critical Difference Identified:**

**Individual Activity Deletion (✅ WORKS):**
- Uses `repository.deleteActivity()` 
- Calls `configurationManager.decrementLifetimeActivityCount(1)` for each activity
- Properly decrements lifetime counter

**Piece Deletion (❌ BROKEN):**
- Uses `repository.deletePieceAndActivities()` 
- Calls `activityDao.deleteActivitiesForPiece()` - **BULK SQL DELETE**
- **NEVER calls lifetime counter decrement**
- Activities are deleted from database but lifetime counter remains unchanged

**Root Cause:**
The piece deletion flow uses a **bulk SQL DELETE operation** that bypasses the individual activity deletion logic entirely. Unlike individual activity deletion which calls `deleteActivity()` (and thus decrements the lifetime counter), piece deletion directly calls the DAO's bulk delete method.

**Technical Analysis:**
- **Bulk Delete**: `deleteActivitiesForPiece()` executes raw SQL: `DELETE FROM activities WHERE pieceOrTechniqueId = :pieceId`
- **No Iteration**: Does not loop through activities to call individual deletion logic  
- **No Counter Update**: Never calls `configurationManager.decrementLifetimeActivityCount()`
- **Direct Database**: Removes records directly from Room database without triggering application-level deletion logic

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Stored Activities**: ✅ Correctly decreases (database reflects actual deletion)
- **Lifetime Activities**: ❌ Remains unchanged (persistent counter not updated)
- **Severity**: High - creates permanent data inconsistency that accumulates over time

**Relationship to DevCycle 2025-0008 Phase 6:**
- **Same Root Problem**: Missing lifetime counter decrements on deletion
- **Different Code Path**: Phase 6 fixed individual deletions, but piece deletion uses separate bulk deletion path
- **Architectural Gap**: Bulk operations don't integrate with application-level counter management

**Solution Requirements:**
The piece deletion method needs to either:
1. **Get activity count BEFORE deletion** and decrement lifetime counter by that amount, OR  
2. **Iterate through activities** and call `deleteActivity()` for each one (slower but consistent)

**Files Involved:**
- `PianoRepository.kt`: `deletePieceAndActivities()` method (lines 54-60)
- `ActivityDao.kt`: `deleteActivitiesForPiece()` method (line 40-41)
- `PiecesViewModel.kt`: `deletePiece()` method (line 167)
- `ConfigurationManager.kt`: `decrementLifetimeActivityCount()` method (available from Phase 6 fix)

**Solution Implemented:**

**Fix Applied to `PianoRepository.deletePieceAndActivities()`:**
```kotlin
suspend fun deletePieceAndActivities(pieceId: Long) {
    // Count activities before deletion to update lifetime counter
    val activitiesToDelete = getActivitiesForPiece(pieceId).first()
    val activityCount = activitiesToDelete.size
    
    // First delete all activities for this piece
    activityDao.deleteActivitiesForPiece(pieceId)
    
    // Decrement lifetime activity counter for user deletions
    if (activityCount > 0) {
        configurationManager.decrementLifetimeActivityCount(activityCount)
    }
    
    // Then delete the piece itself
    val piece = pieceOrTechniqueDao.getById(pieceId)
    piece?.let { pieceOrTechniqueDao.delete(it) }
}
```

**Key Implementation Details:**

**1. Pre-Deletion Activity Count:**
- Uses `getActivitiesForPiece(pieceId).first()` to get current activities before deletion
- Counts total activities to be deleted for accurate lifetime counter adjustment

**2. Lifetime Counter Integration:**
- Calls `configurationManager.decrementLifetimeActivityCount(activityCount)` 
- Uses same `decrementLifetimeActivityCount()` method added in DevCycle 2025-0008 Phase 6
- Only decrements if `activityCount > 0` to avoid unnecessary operations

**3. Preserved Original Flow:**
- Maintains same deletion order: activities first, then piece
- Preserves all existing piece deletion logic and statistics updates
- Ensures data integrity throughout the deletion process

**4. Consistency with Individual Deletion:**
- Now matches the pattern used in `deleteActivity()` for individual deletions
- Both methods properly decrement lifetime counter for user deletions
- Maintains architectural consistency across all deletion flows

**Technical Benefits:**
- **Accurate Counting**: Lifetime counter now reflects actual database state
- **Bulk Efficiency**: Decrements counter once with total count instead of per-activity
- **Data Consistency**: Eliminates permanent data inconsistency accumulation
- **Future-Proof**: Works correctly regardless of number of activities per piece

**Files Modified:**
- `PianoRepository.kt`: Updated `deletePieceAndActivities()` method (lines 54-70)

**Bug Resolution:**
- ❌ **Before**: Piece deletion removed activities from database but never updated lifetime counter
- ✅ **After**: Piece deletion counts activities before deletion and decrements lifetime counter accordingly
- **Result**: Both Stored Activities and Lifetime Activities counts decrease correctly when pieces with activities are deleted

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Research piece deletion flow in codebase
- [x] Compare piece deletion vs individual activity deletion implementations  
- [x] Identify why lifetime counter is not decremented during piece deletion
- [x] Document root cause and relationship to DevCycle 2025-0008 Phase 6
- [x] Implement fix to ensure lifetime counter decreases when piece with activities is deleted
- [x] Verify both Stored and Lifetime Activities counts decrease correctly on piece deletion
- [x] Test that piece deletion without activities doesn't affect lifetime counter
- [x] Ensure fix doesn't break existing individual activity deletion functionality

### Phase 3: Fix Piece Title Text Clipping in Detail View
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-30  
**Date Completed:** 2025-07-30  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Fix UI issue where long piece titles in the piece detail view are vertically cut off on the last line. When viewing piece details from the Pieces tab, titles that span multiple lines have their bottom portion clipped, making the text partially unreadable.

**Bug Analysis:**
- **User Report**: Long piece titles are vertically cut off in piece detail view
- **Expected Behavior**: Full piece title should be visible with proper text layout and spacing
- **Current Behavior**: Last line of multi-line titles is partially clipped/cut off vertically
- **Scope**: Affects piece detail view accessed from Pieces tab
- **Impact**: Reduces readability and user experience when viewing pieces with longer titles

**Technical Context:**
- Issue occurs in piece detail view/dialog when titles exceed single line width
- Likely related to TextView height constraints, padding, or layout parameters
- May involve insufficient vertical space allocation for multi-line text
- Could be caused by fixed height constraints or improper line spacing calculations

**Investigation Required:**
- Identify the piece detail view layout file and TextView implementation
- Analyze TextView height constraints and layout parameters for piece titles
- Check if issue is caused by fixed height, insufficient padding, or line height problems
- Examine how multi-line text is handled in the piece detail view
- Test with various title lengths to understand clipping behavior
- Compare with other text views in the app that handle multi-line text correctly

**Potential Root Causes:**
- TextView has fixed height that doesn't accommodate multiple lines
- Insufficient bottom padding or margin in TextView or parent container
- Line height or line spacing issues causing vertical text overlap
- Layout constraints preventing TextView from expanding vertically
- Parent container height restrictions limiting TextView expansion

**Root Cause Analysis:**

**Piece Detail View Implementation:**
- **Location**: Detail view shown in `PiecesFragment` when piece is selected (PiecesFragment.kt:96-100)
- **Layout File**: `fragment_pieces.xml` - piece details card (lines 110-321)
- **Title TextView**: `pieceNameText` (lines 136-142) in header section of detail card

**Code Flow Analysis:**
```kotlin
// PiecesFragment.kt:103-108
private fun showPieceDetails(details: PieceDetails) {
    binding.pieceDetailsCard.visibility = View.VISIBLE
    val piece = details.piece
    binding.pieceNameText.text = piece.name  // ← Sets piece title text
    // ... rest of detail view population
}
```

**Layout Analysis:**
```xml
<!-- fragment_pieces.xml lines 136-142 -->
<TextView
    android:id="@+id/pieceNameText"
    android:layout_width="0dp"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_weight="1"
    android:textAppearance="?attr/textAppearanceHeadline6" />
```

**Root Cause Identified:**
The piece title TextView in the detail view was missing adequate bottom padding, causing multi-line titles to have their last line vertically clipped. The TextView had:
- ✅ Correct width handling (`0dp` with `layout_weight="1"`)
- ✅ Correct height handling (`wrap_content`)
- ✅ Appropriate text appearance (`textAppearanceHeadline6`)
- ❌ **Missing bottom padding** for multi-line text spacing

**Technical Analysis:**
- **TextView Properties**: Used `wrap_content` height which should accommodate multiple lines
- **Layout Constraints**: Properly weighted in horizontal LinearLayout
- **Text Appearance**: `textAppearanceHeadline6` provides larger text size that can wrap
- **Missing Element**: No bottom padding to provide visual breathing room for text descenders
- **Clipping Cause**: Text descenders (g, j, p, q, y) and line spacing extending beyond implicit TextView bounds

**Solution Implemented:**
```xml
<TextView
    android:id="@+id/pieceNameText"
    android:layout_width="0dp"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_weight="1"
    android:textAppearance="?attr/textAppearanceHeadline6"
    android:paddingBottom="4dp" />  <!-- ✅ Added bottom padding -->
```

**Implementation Details:**
- **Added**: `android:paddingBottom="4dp"` to provide adequate spacing
- **Padding Value**: 4dp provides sufficient clearance for text descenders and multi-line spacing
- **Conservative Approach**: Small padding value maintains existing layout proportions
- **Consistent Design**: Matches padding patterns used elsewhere in the layout

**Files Modified:**
- `fragment_pieces.xml`: Added `android:paddingBottom="4dp"` to `pieceNameText` TextView (line 142)

**Bug Resolution:**
- ❌ **Before**: Multi-line piece titles had last line vertically clipped
- ✅ **After**: Full piece titles visible with proper spacing and no clipping
- **Visual Impact**: Improved readability for long piece names without affecting shorter titles

**Implementation Completed:**

**UI Components Added:**

**1. Edit Icon in Piece List Items:**
- **Location**: `item_piece_stats.xml` - added `editIcon` between addActivityIcon and favoriteIcon
- **Icon**: Uses `@drawable/ic_edit` with consistent 32dp sizing and styling
- **Placement**: Positioned logically in icon sequence: Add → Edit → Favorite → Delete
- **Accessibility**: Includes proper `contentDescription="Edit piece"`

**2. Edit Dialog Layout:**
- **File**: `dialog_edit_piece.xml` - new dialog layout for piece editing
- **Design**: Matches Add Piece dialog styling with Material Design components
- **Fields**: 
  - `TextInputEditText` for piece name editing with `textCapWords` input type
  - `RadioGroup` with Piece/Technique selection options
  - Save/Cancel button layout in horizontal arrangement

**3. Edit Dialog Fragment:**
- **File**: `EditPieceDialogFragment.kt` - new DialogFragment for edit functionality
- **Features**:
  - Pre-populates fields with current piece data (name, type)
  - Validates input (non-empty title requirement)
  - Integrates with parent fragment's PiecesViewModel
  - Provides user feedback with Toast messages
  - Only updates if changes are detected

**Backend Integration:**

**4. PiecesViewModel Enhancement:**
- **Method**: `updatePiece(pieceId: Long, newName: String, newType: ItemType)`
- **Functionality**:
  - Fetches current piece data using `repository.getPieceOrTechniqueById()`
  - Creates updated piece copy with new name, type, and updated timestamp

**6. Fragment Integration:**
- **File**: `PiecesFragment.kt` - integrated edit functionality
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `onEditClick` callback that creates and shows `EditPieceDialogFragment`
  - Passes piece ID, name, and type to dialog for pre-population
  - Uses existing parentFragmentManager for dialog display

**Data Persistence:**
- **Repository**: Uses existing `updatePieceOrTechnique()` method in `PianoRepository`
- **Database**: Leverages Room's `@Update` annotation in DAO for efficient updates
- **Statistics**: Preserves all piece statistics, activity associations, and favorite status
- **Timestamp**: Updates `lastUpdated` field to track modification time

**User Experience Features:**
