### Phase 2: Simplify Favorited Practice Suggestions Algorithm
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-11  
**Date Completed:** 2025-08-12  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Simplify the favorited practice suggestions algorithm to use a straightforward 14-hour exclusion period and prioritize least recently practiced pieces. Replace the current complex "2 days AND not today" logic with a simpler, more predictable approach.

**Current Complex Logic:**
- Favorites excluded if: (practiced within 2 days) OR (practiced today)
- Double filtering with `twoDaysAgo` AND `startOfToday` creates confusing behavior
- Additional fallback exclusion logic adds complexity

**Proposed Simplified Algorithm:**
1. **Filter**: Select all favorited pieces NOT practiced OR performed in the last 14 hours
2. **Sort**: Order by least recently practiced/performed piece first (oldest activity first)
3. **Limit**: Apply user limits (1 for Free users, 4 for Pro users)
4. **Return**: Final favorited practice suggestions list

**Technical Changes Needed:**
- Replace complex dual-condition filtering in `SuggestionsService.generatePracticeSuggestions()`
- Create 14-hour threshold calculation (14 * 60 * 60 * 1000 milliseconds)
- Consider both practice AND performance activities for exclusion
- Sort by oldest `lastActivityDate` (practice or performance) first
- Remove fallback "today" exclusion logic for favorites

**Expected Benefits:**
- More predictable and consistent favorite suggestions
- Simpler logic easier to understand and maintain
- Favorites get more opportunities to appear (14 hours vs current ~48 hours)
- Clear prioritization of pieces that haven't been touched recently

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Investigate current favorited practice suggestion filtering logic
- [x] Implement 14-hour exclusion period for favorited pieces
- [x] Consider both practice AND performance activities in exclusion logic
- [x] Sort favorited pieces by least recently practiced/performed first (existing logic maintained)
- [x] Apply correct user limits (1 for Free, 4 for Pro users) (existing logic maintained)
- [x] Remove complex dual-condition filtering logic
- [x] Update fallback logic to use consistent 14-hour exclusion
- [x] Test that favorited pieces practiced/performed 14+ hours ago appear in suggestions
- [x] Verify favorited pieces practiced/performed within 14 hours are excluded
- [x] Confirm no regression in non-favorite suggestion logic
- [x] Validate sorting prioritizes least recently touched favorites

### Phase 3: Improve Practice Suggestion Time Display Precision
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-12  
**Date Completed:** 2025-08-12  
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:** Enhance the user experience of practice suggestions by displaying more precise time information for recently practiced pieces. When a practice suggestion shows a piece that was last practiced or performed less than 2 days ago, display the time in hours instead of days for better granularity.

**Current Behavior:**
- All suggestions show time in days: "Last practice 1 day ago"
- This is imprecise for recent activities (e.g., 25 hours ago shows as "1 day ago")

**Proposed Enhancement:**
- For pieces last practiced/performed < 48 hours ago: display in hours ("Last practice 25 hours ago")
- For pieces last practiced/performed ≥ 48 hours ago: continue displaying in days ("Last practice 3 days ago")
- Apply this logic to both practice and performance suggestion reason text

**Technical Implementation:**
- Update `SuggestionsService.generatePracticeSuggestions()` suggestion reason logic
- Update `SuggestionsService.generatePerformanceSuggestions()` suggestion reason logic
- Calculate hours elapsed: `((now - lastActivityDate) / (60 * 60 * 1000)).toInt()`
- Use conditional logic: if < 48 hours, show hours; else show days

**Expected Benefits:**
- More accurate time representation for recent activities
- Better user understanding of when they last practiced pieces
- Improved decision-making for practice session planning
- Enhanced user experience with more precise information

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Update practice suggestion reason text to show hours when < 48 hours elapsed
- [x] Update performance suggestion reason text to show hours when < 48 hours elapsed
- [x] Ensure proper hour/hours pluralization ("1 hour ago" vs "25 hours ago")
- [x] Maintain existing day display for activities ≥ 48 hours ago
- [x] Test display accuracy for various time ranges (1 hour, 23 hours, 47 hours, 49 hours)
- [x] Verify no regression in existing suggestion logic or sorting
- [x] Confirm suggestion reason text remains user-friendly and clear

### Phase 4: Fix Dark Mode Text Visibility in Add Notes Dialog
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-18  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Fix the dark mode text visibility issue where the "Add Notes" text input field for performances shows white text on a white background, making it unreadable for users in dark mode.

**Current Issue:**
- In dark mode, the "Add Notes" text input field displays white text on a white background
- This makes the text completely invisible and unusable for users
- Affects the user experience when trying to add notes to performance records

**Proposed Solution:**
- Update the text input styling to ensure proper contrast in dark mode
- Implement appropriate color theming for the notes input field
- Ensure text remains readable in both light and dark modes
- Apply consistent dark mode styling patterns used elsewhere in the app

**Technical Investigation Needed:**
- Locate the "Add Notes" dialog/activity implementation
- Identify the text input field styling and theme application
- Review current dark mode theming implementation across the app
- Determine the appropriate dark mode colors for text input fields

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Investigate current "Add Notes" dialog implementation and styling
- [x] Identify the specific text input field with visibility issues
- [x] Review existing dark mode color schemes and styling patterns
- [x] Implement proper text color for dark mode (should be light/white)
- [x] Implement proper background color for dark mode (should be dark)
- [x] Ensure sufficient contrast ratio for accessibility compliance
- [x] Test in both light and dark modes to verify visibility
- [x] Verify text input functionality works correctly in both themes
- [x] Ensure consistent styling with other input fields in the app
- [x] Test with various text content to confirm readability
- [x] Validate that placeholder text is also properly themed
- [x] Confirm no regression in light mode appearance

**Implementation Summary:**
- **Root Cause:** The EditText in `fragment_notes_input.xml:37` had hardcoded `android:background="@android:color/white"` causing white text on white background in dark mode
- **Files Modified:**
  - Created `app/src/main/res/values-night/colors.xml` with dark mode color definitions
  - Updated `app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml` with light mode text input colors
  - Modified `app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_notes_input.xml` to use theme-aware colors
  - Fixed `app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_time_input.xml` for consistent text visibility
- **Solution:** Replaced hardcoded colors with theme-aware color resources:
  - Light mode: `edit_text_background=#FFFFFFFF, edit_text_text=#FF000000, edit_text_hint=#FF666666`
  - Dark mode: `edit_text_background=#FF2C2C2C, edit_text_text=#FFFFFFFF, edit_text_hint=#FFCCCCCC`
- **Additional Fix:** Applied consistent theming to time input EditText field
- **Result:** Text inputs now properly adapt to both light and dark themes with sufficient contrast
