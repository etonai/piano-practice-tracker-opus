# Development Cycle 2025-0017

**Status:** ðŸŽ« Open  
**Start Date:** 2025-09-01  
**Focus:** Privacy Policy and Terms of Service Implementation

## Overview

This development cycle focuses on implementing Privacy Policy and Terms of Service functionality for PlayStreak. This includes creating the legal documents, implementing UI screens to display them, and ensuring compliance with app store requirements and privacy regulations.

## Initial Plan Overview

DC 17 is about integrating existing Privacy Policy and Terms of Service documents into PlayStreak.

**Note:** Privacy Policy and Terms of Service documents have already been created and are located in the playstreak-legal directory.

Legal documents and compliance features needed:
- Privacy Policy screen accessible from Settings
- Terms of Service screen accessible from Settings
- First-time user agreement flow (if required)
- Legal document versioning and update notification system

The Privacy Policy should cover:
- Data collection practices (user-generated content, analytics, crash reporting)
- Data storage and security measures
- Third-party services integration (Firebase, analytics)
- User rights and data access/deletion procedures
- Contact information for privacy inquiries

The Terms of Service should cover:
- Acceptable use policies
- User responsibilities and restrictions
- Intellectual property rights
- Service availability and modifications
- Liability limitations and disclaimers
- Dispute resolution procedures

Implementation requirements:
- Dedicated fragments/screens for Privacy Policy and Terms of Service
- Navigation from Settings screen to legal documents
- Scrollable text display with proper formatting
- Version tracking for legal document updates
- Accessibility compliance for legal text

### Claude Notes on Initial Plan Overview

- Legal documents can be stored as assets (HTML/markdown) or hardcoded strings for easy updates
- Version tracking system for legal document updates and user notification
- Potential integration with onboarding flow for new users
- Settings screen enhancement with legal document navigation

**UI Implementation Areas:**
- New PrivacyPolicyFragment with scrollable text display
- New TermsOfServiceFragment with scrollable text display
- Update SettingsFragment with navigation buttons to legal documents

- Proper accessibility support for long-form legal content

**Legal Content Considerations:**
- Privacy Policy must accurately reflect actual data practices
- Terms of Service should be legally appropriate and enforceable
- Regular review and updates as app functionality changes
- Clear, understandable language while maintaining legal accuracy

- Requires content extraction and formatting

**UI Components Required:**
- PrivacyPolicyFragment with WebView/ScrollView
- TermsOfServiceFragment with WebView/ScrollView  
- Settings screen navigation buttons
- Legal document version tracking
