# Development Cycle 2025-0016

**Status:** In Progress  
**Start Date:** 2025-08-31  
**Focus:** Adding Achievements to PlayStreak

## Overview

This development cycle focuses on implementing an achievements system for PlayStreak. The achievements system will provide additional motivation and engagement for users by recognizing various milestones and accomplishments beyond the existing streak milestone system.

## Initial Plan Overview

DC 16 is about adding achievements to PlayStreak.

- Achievements Screen
- Achievements Button in Settings to go to Achievements Screen

Tracking the following achievements:
- Added first piece
- Added first technique
- First Practice Activity
- First Performance Activity
- First Online Performance
- First Live Performance

The first time hitting each streak level will also need an achievement

Each achievement will need its own icon(s). 

The Settings screen will list the number of achievements achieved, and the total number of achievements available

The Achievements Screen will display the number of achievements achieved, and the total number of achievements available. It will also list each achievement and the datetime it was achieved. And it will list the icon(s) for that achievement. The streak achievements should use the same icons that the streaks use.

Analytics will stop tracking streaks, and will instead track each achievement

The import/export file will include achievements data.

STRETCH GOAL - When an achievement is hit, some kind of animated celebration will display on PlayStreak, over the current app screen

### Claude Notes on Initial Plan Overview

**System Architecture Considerations:**
- Need new database table/entity for achievements with fields: id, type, title, description, iconResource, unlockedAt, isUnlocked
- Achievement tracking requires integration points in existing ViewModels (AddActivityViewModel, QuickAddActivityViewModel, AddPieceViewModel)
- Streak achievements can leverage existing streak calculation logic from milestone system

**UI Implementation Areas:**
- New AchievementsFragment with RecyclerView for achievement list display
- AchievementsAdapter for achievement items with icon + title + unlock date
- Update SettingsFragment with achievement count display and navigation button
- Achievement celebration overlay system (stretch goal)

**Achievement Types to Implement:**
1. **First Actions**: First piece, first technique, first practice, first performance, first online/live performance
2. **Streak Milestones**: Reuse existing milestone logic (3, 5, 8, 14, 30, 61, 91 days) with achievement tracking
3. **Future Extensibility**: Architecture should support additional achievement categories

**Analytics Migration:**
- Replace streak milestone analytics with achievement analytics events
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Achievement unlock events with achievement type/name tracking

**Data Persistence:**
- Extend JsonExporter/JsonImporter to include achievements data
- Database migration for new achievements table
- Sync achievements data in SyncManager if applicable

**Technical Dependencies:**
- Review existing streak milestone icons for reuse in streak achievements
- Icon resources needed for first action achievements
- Achievement unlock detection logic in activity/piece creation workflows

### Claude Notes on Stretch Goal

**Difficulty Assessment: Medium** üü°

**What makes it manageable:**
- Android has excellent animation framework support
- Several technical approaches available with varying complexity
- Can start simple and enhance over time
- Existing achievement detection logic provides clear trigger points

**Technical Implementation Options:**

**Approach 1: Dialog-Based (Easiest)**
- Custom `DialogFragment` with celebration animations
- Pros: Simple, contained, works across all screens
- Cons: Feels more intrusive, modal experience

**Approach 2: Overlay View (Recommended)**
- Add celebration view to activity's root `ViewGroup`
- Pros: Non-blocking, feels more integrated
- Cons: Need to handle across multiple activities

**Approach 3: Fragment Overlay (Best UX)**
- Celebration fragment that overlays current content
- Pros: Smooth, integrated, dismissible
- Cons: More complex architecture

**Main Challenges:**
1. **Global Architecture**: Need celebration system that works across all screens
2. **Animation Polish**: Making celebrations feel rewarding vs. annoying
3. **Timing Logic**: When exactly to trigger (immediately, on next screen, etc.)
4. **Performance**: Ensuring animations are smooth and don't lag

**Suggested Incremental Approach:**
1. **Phase 1**: Simple toast/snackbar notifications
2. **Phase 2**: Basic dialog with fade animation
3. **Phase 3**: Custom overlay with enhanced animations (confetti, particles)
4. **Phase 4**: Lottie animations or advanced celebration effects

**Existing Code Leverage:**
- Your milestone detection logic already exists
- Can integrate with existing `AnalyticsManager`
- Achievement unlock events provide perfect trigger points

**Verdict**: Great stretch goal! Start with simple animations and enhance based on user feedback. The foundation you have makes this very doable.

### Claude Questions

**Achievement System Architecture:**
1. Should achievements be retroactive? (e.g., if user already has pieces/activities, unlock those achievements immediately on first app launch after implementation?) - YES
2. What happens to existing streak milestone analytics events during the transition to achievement-based analytics? - Stop tracking those analytics. Do not worry that have have old analytics.

**UI/UX Design:**
3. For the Settings screen, should the achievement count display be a simple text ("5/12 achievements") or a progress bar/visual indicator? - Simple text
4. Should the Achievements screen group achievements by category (First Actions, Streak Milestones, etc.) or display them chronologically by unlock date? - Category
5. What should happen when a user clicks on a locked achievement? Show requirements/hint or no interaction? - No interaction

**Achievement Definitions:**
6. For "First Online Performance" vs "First Live Performance" - how does the app distinguish between these? Is this based on existing performance type selection in the app? - Yes, it is based on performance type selection
7. Should streak achievements unlock immediately upon reaching the streak, or only after completing a practice session on that streak day? - Immediately

**Data and Migration:**
8. Since this will "stop tracking streaks" in analytics, should we maintain the existing streak milestone celebration UI in the app, or replace it entirely with the new achievement system? - keep the existing streak milestone celebration
9. For import/export, should achievements data be a separate section or integrated with existing user data structure? - Separate section

**Implementation Scope:**
10. Are there any specific icon style preferences (Material Design icons, custom illustrations, emoji-style, etc.)? - Emoji style
11. Should the achievement celebration (stretch goal) be user-configurable (enable/disable, animation intensity) or always-on when implemented? - Enable/Disable, make it configurable in the Configuration page. Enable by default.
