## Previous Cycle Summary

DevCycle 2025-0011 completed the following phases:
1. ðŸŽ« Test Build 1.0.8.26-beta (Phase 1) - Open
2. âœ… Enhance Dashboard Week Summary with Specific Metrics and Bullet Points (Phase 2)
3. âœ… Implement Duplicate Piece Name Validation (Phase 3)

### Phase 2: Enhance Analytics Tracking Implementation
**Status:** ðŸŽ« Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-05  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Implement comprehensive analytics tracking enhancements to capture user behavior insights and feature usage patterns. This phase addresses significant gaps in the current Firebase Analytics implementation identified in the analytics analysis.

**Implementation Priority Order:**
1. **Immediate:** Streak achievement tracking (user engagement insights)
2. **High:** Enhanced activity source tracking (UI effectiveness measurement)
3. **High:** Piece addition tracking with context (content growth patterns)
4. **Medium:** JSON import/export operation tracking (power user insights)
5. **Medium:** Data pruning operation tracking (data management insights)

**Technical Implementation:**

**Priority 1 - Streak Achievement Tracking:**
- Implement `trackStreakAchieved()` calls in streak calculation logic
- Track milestone achievements (3ðŸŽµ, 5ðŸŽ¶, 8ðŸ”¥, 14ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥+ days)
- Identify user engagement patterns and retention drop-off points

**Priority 2 - Enhanced Activity Source Tracking:**
- Update `trackActivityLogged()` to include source parameter
- Add source context: "main_flow", "dashboard_quick", "calendar_quick", "suggestion"
- Implement in `AddActivityViewModel`, `QuickAddActivityDialogFragment`, calendar quick add, and suggestions flow

**Priority 3 - Piece Addition Context Tracking:**
- Implement `trackPieceAdded()` calls with source parameter
- Track "pieces_tab" vs "during_activity_creation" contexts
- Add to `AddPieceViewModel` and `AddNewPieceFragment`

**Priority 4 - JSON Import/Export Tracking:**
- Update `trackCsvOperation()` method to `trackDataOperation()` for JSON support
- Implement tracking in `JsonExporter.kt` and `JsonImporter.kt`
- Track operation success rates and data volumes

**Priority 5 - Data Pruning Operation Tracking:**
- Add new `trackDataPruning()` method to `AnalyticsManager`
- Track single pruning operation: deletion of 100 oldest activities, actual count deleted, success status
- Implement in `PruneDataViewModel.pruneOldestActivities()` method
- Track how frequently users utilize the data pruning feature

**Files Requiring Updates:**
- `AnalyticsManager.kt` - Add source parameters, update CSVâ†’JSON tracking method, add data pruning tracking method
- `AddActivityViewModel.kt` - Pass activity source context
- `AddPieceViewModel.kt` - Add piece tracking calls
- `QuickAddActivityDialogFragment.kt` - Pass "dashboard_quick" source
- `StreakCalculator.kt` or Dashboard - Add streak achievement calls
- `JsonExporter.kt` - Add JSON export operation tracking
- `JsonImporter.kt` - Add JSON import operation tracking
- `ImportExportViewModel.kt` - Integrate JSON tracking calls
- `PruneDataViewModel.kt` - Add data pruning operation tracking

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Implement streak achievement tracking with milestone detection
- [ ] Add activity source context tracking for all entry points
- [ ] Implement piece addition tracking with source context
- [ ] Update data operation tracking for JSON import/export
- [ ] Implement data pruning operation tracking with operation details
- [ ] Test analytics events appear correctly in Firebase Console
- [ ] Verify all existing functionality continues to work
- [ ] Document analytics enhancement implementation
- [ ] Validate analytics data collection compliance with privacy policy

**Business Value:**
- Track user engagement patterns and streak retention rates
- Measure UI feature effectiveness (quick add vs main flow vs suggestions)
- Understand content growth patterns and user onboarding success
- Monitor power user feature adoption (JSON import/export)
- Track data management behavior and pruning feature usage patterns

## Future Cycles
