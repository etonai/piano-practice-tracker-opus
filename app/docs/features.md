**Status:** Implemented  
**Date Requested:** 2025-07-21  
**Date Implemented:** 2025-07-21  
**Priority:** High  
**Requested By:** Business Development  

**Description:**  
Implement a Pro Mode system that differentiates between Free and Pro users, with Pro users having access to enhanced features and capabilities. This will include a global setting mechanism to track user subscription status and conditionally enable premium features throughout the app.

**User Story:**  
As a business, we want to offer premium features to Pro subscribers so that we can generate revenue while still providing value to free users, and as a Pro user, I want access to enhanced features that justify my subscription cost.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [x] Global `isProUser` setting/preference system
- [x] Pro user status detection and persistence across app sessions
- [ ] UI indicators showing Pro-only features (with upgrade prompts for free users)
- [ ] Graceful feature limiting for free users without breaking core functionality
- [ ] Pro user onboarding and feature discovery
- [x] Settings screen showing current subscription status
- [x] Feature gate system that can be easily extended for new Pro features
- [ ] Upgrade prompt system for free users attempting to access Pro features

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Implement global user preference system (`SharedPreferences` or Room database)
- Create `ProUserManager` or similar class to handle Pro status checks
- Design feature gate annotations or utility methods for easy Pro feature implementation
- Update UI components to show Pro badges/indicators where appropriate
- Consider future integration with Google Play Billing for actual subscription management
- Ensure backwards compatibility and graceful degradation for free users
- Create consistent upgrade prompt UI patterns

**Priority Justification:**  
High priority as this establishes the foundation for monetization strategy and must be implemented before rolling out premium features. This system will enable future revenue generation while maintaining a good free user experience.

**Implementation Details:**
- **ProUserManager**: Created singleton class managing Pro status via SharedPreferences
- **Storage**: Uses `playstreak_pro_prefs` SharedPreferences with `is_pro_user` boolean key
- **API**: Provides `isProUser()`, `setProUser(boolean)`, `toggleProStatus()`, and `resetToFreeUser()` methods
- **Testing**: Added Pro status toggle button in Settings for development/testing purposes
- **Future Migration**: Architecture supports easy integration with Google Play Billing later

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/utils/ProUserManager.kt` (new)
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/main/MainFragment.kt`
- `app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_main.xml`

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Start with simple boolean flag system that can be extended later
- Design UI patterns that clearly communicate value of Pro features
- Ensure all existing features remain available to free users initially
- Plan migration path for implementing actual subscription system later

**Priority:** High  
**Requested By:** Product Team  

**Description:**  
Implement a limited heat map feature for the calendar that differentiates between Free and Pro users. Free users will see a simplified heat map where days with any activities show as light blue, while Pro users will see the full heat map with multiple color intensities based on activity levels.

**User Story:**  
As a Free user, I want to see which days I practiced (light blue) so that I can track my practice consistency, and as a Pro user, I want to see detailed activity intensity levels so that I can better understand my practice patterns and volume.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [x] Free users see binary heat map: no color for days with no activities, light blue for days with any activities
- [x] Pro users see full heat map with multiple color intensities based on activity count/duration
- [x] Heat map updates immediately when Pro status changes
- [x] Consistent visual experience within each user tier
- [x] Clear visual differentiation between Free and Pro heat map experiences
- [x] Activity Level Color Guide hidden for free users, visible for pro users

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Integrate with existing calendar heat map logic
- Use ProUserManager to determine which heat map to display
- Modify color calculation logic based on user tier

**Priority Justification:**  
High priority as this provides a clear value proposition for Pro users while still giving Free users basic visual feedback about their practice consistency.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Free User Heat Map**: Shows light blue (`#B3D9FF`) for any day with activities, white for no activities
- **Pro User Heat Map**: Full heat map with intensity levels:
  - Practice days: Light blue ‚Üí Medium blue ‚Üí Dark blue (based on activity count)
  - Performance days: Light green ‚Üí Medium green ‚Üí Dark green (based on activity count)
- **Activity Level Color Guide**: 
  - Hidden (`View.GONE`) for free users - no need to show complex legend for simple heat map
  - Visible (`View.VISIBLE`) for Pro users - shows detailed legend for 6 different color/intensity levels
- **Pro Status Detection**: Uses `ProUserManager.isProUser()` to determine which heat map to display
- **Dynamic Updates**: Calendar and color guide refresh in `onResume()` when Pro status changes
- **Preserved Logic**: All existing Pro heat map logic maintained for Pro users

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/CalendarFragment.kt`
- `app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_calendar.xml`

**Implementation Notes:**

**Priority:** High  
**Requested By:** Product Team  

**Description:**  
Implement a simple restriction where Free users cannot add new favorites if they already have 4 or more favorites. Pro users have unlimited favorites. The restriction only applies to adding new favorites - removing favorites is always allowed for all users.

**Priority:** High  
**Requested By:** Product Team  

**Description:**  
Limit Free users to only 1 favorite suggestion (instead of 2) in both the Dashboard and Suggestions tab. Free users will always see their least recently practiced/performed favorite piece as the single suggestion. If they have no favorite pieces, no favorite suggestions are shown. Pro users continue to see up to 4 favorite suggestions.

**User Story:**  
As a business, we want to further limit favorite suggestions for Free users to provide even stronger Pro upgrade incentive, while as a Free user, I still get the most important favorite suggestion (my most neglected favorite piece) to maintain practice value.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
