**Date Implemented:** 2025-07-21  
**Priority:** High  
**Requested By:** Business Development  

**Description:**  
Implement a Pro Mode system that differentiates between Free and Pro users, with Pro users having access to enhanced features and capabilities. This will include a global setting mechanism to track user subscription status and conditionally enable premium features throughout the app.

**User Story:**  
As a business, we want to offer premium features to Pro subscribers so that we can generate revenue while still providing value to free users, and as a Pro user, I want access to enhanced features that justify my subscription cost.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [x] Global `isProUser` setting/preference system
- [x] Pro user status detection and persistence across app sessions
- [ ] UI indicators showing Pro-only features (with upgrade prompts for free users)
- [ ] Graceful feature limiting for free users without breaking core functionality
- [ ] Pro user onboarding and feature discovery
- [x] Settings screen showing current subscription status
- [x] Feature gate system that can be easily extended for new Pro features
- [ ] Upgrade prompt system for free users attempting to access Pro features

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Implement global user preference system (`SharedPreferences` or Room database)
- Create `ProUserManager` or similar class to handle Pro status checks

  - Hidden (`View.GONE`) for free users - no need to show complex legend for simple heat map
  - Visible (`View.VISIBLE`) for Pro users - shows detailed legend for 6 different color/intensity levels
- **Pro Status Detection**: Uses `ProUserManager.isProUser()` to determine which heat map to display
- **Dynamic Updates**: Calendar and color guide refresh in `onResume()` when Pro status changes
- **Preserved Logic**: All existing Pro heat map logic maintained for Pro users

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/CalendarFragment.kt`

Hide the Switch to Pro/Free button in production builds using BuildConfig.DEBUG while keeping it visible in debug builds for testing. This ensures production users don't see testing functionality while maintaining developer/tester access to Pro status switching.

**User Story:**  
As a production user, I should not see testing buttons that allow switching between Pro and Free modes, while as a developer or tester, I want access to the Pro/Free switch button in debug builds to test different user experiences.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Switch to Pro/Free button hidden in production/release builds
- [ ] Switch to Pro/Free button visible in debug builds
- [ ] Uses BuildConfig.DEBUG to control visibility
- [ ] Button functionality unchanged when visible
- [ ] No impact on other Pro/Free differentiation logic
- [ ] Clean production UI without testing artifacts
- [ ] Easy testing access in debug builds

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Locate Switch to Pro/Free button in Settings or main interface
- Wrap button visibility with `if (BuildConfig.DEBUG)` condition
- Ensure button container/layout adjusts properly when hidden
- Maintain existing button functionality when visible
- Consider using `View.GONE` vs `View.INVISIBLE` for clean layout
- Test both debug and release build variants

**Priority Justification:**  
High priority for production release cleanliness. Testing buttons should not be visible to production users as they create confusion and expose internal functionality not intended for end users.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Visibility Control**: Use `button.visibility = if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) View.VISIBLE else View.GONE`
- **Location**: Find Switch to Pro/Free button in Settings screen or similar
- **Layout**: Ensure parent layout handles hidden button gracefully
- **Testing**: Verify button works in debug builds and is hidden in release builds
- **Clean UI**: Production users see polished interface without testing elements

### Feature #14: üí° Build Variant Default Pro Status
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented  
**Date Requested:** 2025-07-22  
**Date Implemented:** 2025-07-22  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Requested By:** Business Team  

**Description:**  
Set different default Pro status based on build variant: Free mode default for release builds (production users), Pro mode default for debug builds (developers/testers). This ensures production users get the intended Free experience while developers can easily test Pro features.

**User Story:**  
As a production user installing PlayStreak, I should automatically start with the Free experience, while as a developer or tester using debug builds, I should start with Pro access to easily test all features without manual switching.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Release builds: New installations default to Free mode (isProUser = false)
- [ ] Debug builds: New installations default to Pro mode (isProUser = true)
- [ ] ProUserManager initializes with different defaults based on BuildConfig.DEBUG
- [ ] Release builds: All Free tier limitations active from first app launch
- [ ] Debug builds: All Pro features accessible from first app launch
- [ ] Consistent experience within each build variant
- [ ] Fresh installs show appropriate UI based on build variant (release=5 tabs, debug=6 tabs)
- [ ] Existing users maintain their current Pro/Free status regardless of build variant

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Update ProUserManager initialization to use BuildConfig.DEBUG for default value
- Modify SharedPreferences default behavior to return build-variant-specific defaults
- Verify that all Pro/Free checks handle both debug and release defaults correctly
- Test fresh installation on both debug and release builds
- Ensure existing user data is not affected by changes (only impacts new installs)
- Consider that debug users may need to manually switch to Free for testing

**Priority Justification:**  
Critical priority for both production release and development efficiency. Production users must start with Free experience for proper evaluation and monetization, while developers need immediate Pro access for efficient feature testing.

**Implementation Approach:**  
- **Default Logic**: Use `BuildConfig.DEBUG ? true : false` as default Pro status for new users
- **Location**: Update ProUserManager.isProUser() method to return build-variant-specific defaults
- **Existing Users**: Preserve current Pro/Free status in SharedPreferences
- **Testing**: Verify debug builds start Pro, release builds start Free
- **ProUserManager Default**: Ensure `isProUser()` returns `false` when no preference exists
- **SharedPreferences**: Use `getBoolean(KEY_IS_PRO_USER, false)` with explicit false default
- **Fresh Install Testing**: Verify new installations show Free tier behavior
- **User Migration**: Ensure existing users (if any) maintain current status
- **Consistency Check**: All Pro/Free logic should assume Free by default

**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented  
**Date Requested:** 2025-07-22  
**Date Implemented:** 2025-07-22  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Requested By:** UI/UX Team  

**Description:**  
Add an "Add Piece" button to the Settings page positioned right after the "Add Activity" button. The button should display the current count of pieces in parentheses (e.g., "Add Piece (12)") to provide users with quick access to piece management and visibility into their repertoire size.

**User Story:**  
As a user, I want quick access to add new pieces from the Settings page and see at a glance how many pieces are in my repertoire, so that I can easily manage my practice library and understand the scope of my collection.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] "Add Piece" button added to Settings page after "Add Activity" button
- [ ] Button shows current piece count in parentheses format: "Add Piece (12)"
- [ ] Piece count updates dynamically when pieces are added/removed
- [ ] Button navigates to Add Piece screen/functionality
- [ ] Consistent styling with existing Settings page buttons
- [ ] Count reflects actual number of pieces in user's library
- [ ] Real-time count updates when returning to Settings page

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Add button to Settings page layout after Add Activity button
- Query repository to get current piece count
- Use LiveData or similar to observe piece count changes
- Navigate to appropriate Add Piece screen when clicked
- Ensure count updates when user returns from adding/removing pieces
- Consider performance impact of frequent count queries
- Handle zero pieces case gracefully ("Add Piece (0)")

**Priority Justification:**  
Medium priority UI enhancement that improves user experience by providing quick access to piece management and useful repertoire size information. Helps users understand and manage their practice library more effectively.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Button Placement**: Add after existing Add Activity button in Settings layout
- **Count Query**: Use repository to get piece count with `repository.getAllPiecesAndTechniques().count { it.type == ItemType.PIECE }`
- **Dynamic Updates**: Observe piece data changes with LiveData
- **Navigation**: Navigate to Add Piece screen (create if doesn't exist)
- **Styling**: Match existing Settings page button design
- **Performance**: Cache count or use efficient query for real-time updates

### Feature #16: üí° Set Application Limits for Activities and Pieces
**Status:** Requested  
**Date Requested:** 2025-07-22  
**Priority:** High  
**Requested By:** Engineering/QA Team  

**Description:**  
Investigate and establish reasonable limits for the number of activities that can be created per day and the total number of pieces the app can hold. Implement these limits with proper validation and user feedback to ensure stable app performance and prevent edge cases that could cause crashes or poor performance.

**User Story:**  
As a user, I want the app to function reliably even with extensive use, and as a developer, I want to ensure the app has tested, guaranteed performance limits rather than unknown breaking points that could cause crashes or poor user experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Research and determine reasonable daily activity limits (e.g., 50-100 activities per day)
- [ ] Research and determine reasonable total piece limits (e.g., 500-1000 pieces)
- [ ] Test app performance at determined limits to ensure stability
- [ ] Implement validation to prevent exceeding limits
- [ ] Provide clear user feedback when approaching/hitting limits
- [ ] Graceful handling when limits are reached (no crashes)
- [ ] Document limits for user support, troubleshooting, and testing documentation
- [ ] Consider different limits for Free vs Pro users if applicable

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Performance testing with large datasets (database queries, UI rendering, memory usage)
- Database performance with thousands of activities and hundreds of pieces
- UI responsiveness with large lists (RecyclerView performance, pagination)
- Memory usage analysis under heavy data loads
- Export/import performance with maximum data sets
- Search and filtering performance with large datasets
- Calendar rendering with many activities per day

**Priority Justification:**  
High priority for app stability and user trust. Having undefined limits creates risk of crashes, poor performance, and bad user experience. Professional apps should have tested, documented limits to ensure reliability.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Research Phase**: Performance testing with synthetic large datasets
- **Limit Determination**: Based on testing results and user research
- **Validation**: Add checks when creating activities/pieces
- **User Feedback**: Clear messages like "Daily activity limit reached (50/50)"
- **Graceful Degradation**: Disable add buttons/show alternative options when limits reached
- **Documentation**: Include limits in user guide, support materials, and testing documentation
- **Monitoring**: Track usage patterns to validate limit appropriateness

**Suggested Research Areas:**
- Database performance with 10,000+ activities and 1,000+ pieces
- Calendar view rendering with 50+ activities per day
- Suggestions algorithm performance with large datasets
- Export file size and generation time limits
- Memory usage patterns under maximum load

### Feature #17: üí° Disable Import From CSV Button for Free Users
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented  
**Date Requested:** 2025-07-22  
**Date Implemented:** 2025-07-22  
**Priority:** High  
**Requested By:** Business Team  

**Description:**  
Disable the Import From CSV button functionality for Free users while keeping it enabled for Pro users. This creates a clear Pro/Free differentiation for advanced data management features while maintaining export functionality for all users to ensure data portability.

**User Story:**  
As a Free user, I should not have access to CSV import functionality, while as a Pro user, I want full data import capabilities so that I can manage my practice data comprehensively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Free users: Import From CSV button disabled/grayed out
- [ ] Pro users: Import From CSV button fully functional
- [ ] Button visual state reflects availability (enabled/disabled styling)
- [ ] Clicking disabled button shows appropriate message (not "Coming Soon")
- [ ] Export functionality remains available to all users
- [ ] Pro/Free status changes update button state immediately
- [ ] Consistent with other Pro/Free feature differentiations

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Update ImportExportFragment to check Pro status for import button state
- Modify button click behavior based on Pro/Free status
- Ensure button styling reflects enabled/disabled state (alpha, colors)
- Replace "Coming Soon" message with Pro feature prompt for consistency
- Test button state changes when Pro status toggles
- Maintain export functionality for all users (data portability)

**Priority Justification:**  
High priority for establishing clear Pro/Free feature boundaries. Import functionality is an advanced data management feature that should be restricted to Pro users while ensuring all users can export their data.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Button State**: Use `button.isEnabled = proUserManager.isProUser()` for import button
- **Visual Styling**: Apply appropriate alpha/styling for disabled state
- **Click Behavior**: Show Pro upgrade prompt when disabled button is clicked
- **Dynamic Updates**: Update button state when Pro status changes in onResume()
- **User Experience**: Clear visual distinction between enabled/disabled states

### Feature #19: ‚úÖ Add Activity from Inactive Tab
**Status:** Implemented  
**Date Requested:** 2025-07-22  
**Date Implemented:** 2025-07-22  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Requested By:** User Feedback  

**Description:**  
Add a quick "Add Activity" feature to the Inactive tab that works like the existing quick add functionality in Suggestions and Pieces tabs. Each piece listed in the Inactive tab should have a small "+" icon that allows users to quickly log an activity for that piece.

**User Story:**  
As a Pro user viewing my inactive pieces, I want to quickly add an activity for a specific piece by tapping a "+" icon, so that I can efficiently resume practice on neglected pieces without navigating through multiple screens to select the piece name.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Add "+" icon to each piece in Inactive tab (Pro users only)
- [ ] Clicking "+" opens the same QuickAddActivityDialog used in Suggestions/Pieces tabs
- [ ] Dialog pre-fills piece name (user cannot change it)
- [ ] Dialog allows selection of Practice vs Performance
- [ ] Dialog shows proper level options matching regular Add Activity flow
- [ ] Performance activities show only 3 levels with performance-specific descriptions
- [ ] Practice activities show 4 levels with practice-specific descriptions  
- [ ] Performance activities include performance type selection (Online/Live)
- [ ] Dialog has Add Activity and Cancel buttons
- [ ] Successful save closes dialog and returns to Inactive tab
- [ ] Activity will appear in timeline/dashboard after saving
- [ ] After logging activity, piece should eventually move out of Inactive tab
- [ ] Icon is visually clear but doesn't dominate the list item
- [ ] Feature restricted to Pro users only (consistent with Inactive tab access)

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Add "+" button/icon to inactive piece item layout
- Reuse existing QuickAddActivityDialogFragment from Feature #18
- Add onAddActivityClick callback to InactiveAdapter
- Update InactiveFragment to handle dialog presentation
- Ensure icon styling matches Suggestions and Pieces tabs
- Consider that pieces may disappear from Inactive list after activity is added
- Test that Inactive tab refreshes properly after activity creation

**Priority Justification:**  
Medium priority UX enhancement that extends the successful quick-add pattern from Feature #18 to the Inactive tab. Provides consistent user experience across all piece-viewing tabs and makes it easier to resume practice on neglected pieces, which directly supports the app's core goal of consistent practice habits.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Reuse Components**: Leverage existing QuickAddActivityDialogFragment and ViewModel
- **UI Consistency**: Use same "+" icon and positioning as Suggestions/Pieces tabs
- **Adapter Pattern**: Follow same pattern as SuggestionsAdapter and PiecesAdapter
- **Fragment Integration**: Add dialog handling to InactiveFragment
- **Pro Restriction**: Maintain consistency with other Pro-only quick-add features
- **Data Flow**: Ensure Inactive list updates properly when pieces become active again

**Implementation Details:**

**UI Components Modified:**
- **item_abandoned.xml**: Added addActivityIcon ImageView with + icon, positioned between piece name and days badge
- Icon styled consistently with other tabs (24dp size, selectableItemBackgroundBorderless background)

**Adapter Updates:**
- **AbandonedAdapter.kt**: Added constructor parameters for onAddActivityClick callback and ProUserManager
- Updated ViewHolder to handle + icon clicks and Pro user visibility control

**Fragment Integration:**
- **AbandonedFragment.kt**: Updated to create adapter with callback and ProUserManager instance
- Added `showQuickAddActivityDialog()` method that reuses existing QuickAddActivityDialogFragment
- Dialog receives abandonedItem.piece.id and abandonedItem.piece.name for pre-filling

**Dialog Reuse:**
- Leverages existing QuickAddActivityDialogFragment and QuickAddActivityViewModel from Feature #18
- No new dialog components needed - maintains UI consistency across all tabs

**Pro User Restriction:**
- + icons only visible when `ProUserManager.getInstance(context).isProUser()` returns true
- Consistent with Inactive tab being Pro-only feature
- Maintains feature differentiation between Free and Pro users

**Data Flow:**
- User clicks + icon ‚Üí showQuickAddActivityDialog() ‚Üí QuickAddActivityDialogFragment
- Dialog pre-fills piece information ‚Üí User selects activity details ‚Üí Activity saved
- After activity creation, piece may naturally move out of Inactive tab on next data refresh

**Files Modified:**

### Feature #20: ‚úÖ Exclude Today's Practiced Favorites from Suggestions
**Status:** Implemented  
**Date Requested:** 2025-07-22  
**Date Implemented:** 2025-07-22  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Requested By:** User Feedback  

**Description:**  
Modify the favorite suggestions logic to exclude any favorite piece that has already been practiced or performed today. Currently, favorites are suggested if they haven't been practiced in 2+ days, but this should be enhanced to never suggest favorites that have been practiced today, regardless of the 2-day rule.

**User Story:**  
As a user who has already practiced a favorite piece today, I don't want to see that piece in my suggestions list, so that my suggestions focus on pieces that still need attention today and don't show me redundant recommendations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Favorite pieces practiced or performed today are excluded from suggestions
- [ ] Applies to both primary suggestions (2+ days rule) and fallback suggestions 
- [ ] "Today" is defined as current calendar day (midnight to midnight)
- [ ] Both PRACTICE and PERFORMANCE activities count as "practiced today"
- [ ] Suggestion logic still follows existing 2+ days rule, but adds today exclusion
- [ ] Fallback logic (least recently practiced) also excludes today's activities
- [ ] No impact on non-favorite suggestion logic
- [ ] Pro and Free user limits remain unchanged
- [ ] Clear suggestion reasons still displayed for remaining suggestions

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Update SuggestionsViewModel favorite suggestion logic
- Add today timestamp calculation (start of current day)
- Filter out pieces with activities >= today timestamp in both primary and fallback logic
- Ensure timezone handling is consistent with existing date calculations
- Update both DashboardViewModel and SuggestionsViewModel for consistency
- Consider edge case where user has practiced all favorites today (empty favorites list)
- Maintain existing sorting and limiting logic for remaining favorites

**Priority Justification:**  
Medium priority UX enhancement that prevents redundant suggestions and helps users focus on pieces that actually need attention. Improves suggestion quality by avoiding pieces already practiced today, making the suggestion system more intelligent and user-friendly.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Today Calculation**: Add `startOfToday` timestamp calculation using current date at 00:00:00
- **Primary Filter**: Update favorite selection to exclude pieces with `lastActivityDate >= startOfToday`  
- **Fallback Filter**: Apply same filter to fallback favorites selection
- **Logic Flow**: 
  1. Calculate `startOfToday = todayMidnight timestamp`
  2. For each favorite: if `lastActivityDate >= startOfToday` ‚Üí exclude
  3. Apply existing 2+ days rule to remaining favorites
  4. Apply fallback logic to remaining favorites if needed
- **Consistency**: Update both SuggestionsViewModel and DashboardViewModel
- **Edge Cases**: Handle scenario where all favorites practiced today (may result in 0 favorite suggestions)

**Implementation Details:**

**Today Calculation:**
- Added `startOfToday` timestamp calculation using `Calendar.getInstance()` set to midnight (00:00:00)
- Consistent implementation across both ViewModels using same calendar logic

**Primary Suggestion Filter Enhancement:**
- **SuggestionsViewModel**: Updated favorite condition from `(lastActivityDate == null || lastActivityDate < twoDaysAgo)` 
- **Enhanced to**: `(lastActivityDate == null || lastActivityDate < twoDaysAgo) && (lastActivityDate == null || lastActivityDate < startOfToday)`
- Same logic applied to DashboardViewModel for consistency

**Fallback Suggestion Filter Enhancement:**
- Added explicit exclusion in fallback favorites mapping: `if (lastActivityDate != null && lastActivityDate >= startOfToday) return@mapNotNull null`
- Applies to both SuggestionsViewModel and DashboardViewModel fallback logic
- Ensures pieces practiced today are excluded from all suggestion paths

**Logic Flow:**
1. Calculate `startOfToday` as current date at 00:00:00 timestamp
2. For each favorite piece: if practiced today (`lastActivityDate >= startOfToday`) ‚Üí exclude from suggestions
3. Apply existing 2+ day rule to remaining (non-today) favorites  
4. Apply same today exclusion to fallback favorites if primary suggestions insufficient
5. Maintain existing Pro/Free limits and sorting logic

**Edge Case Handling:**
- If all favorites practiced today: Results in 0 favorite suggestions (expected behavior)
- Never-practiced pieces (`lastActivityDate == null`): Still eligible for suggestions
- Maintains existing suggestion reasons and display logic

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/SuggestionsViewModel.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/DashboardViewModel.kt`

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Feature enhances suggestion intelligence by preventing redundant recommendations
- Maintains all existing 2+ day logic while adding today exclusion as prerequisite filter
- Both primary and fallback suggestion paths now exclude today's practiced favorites
- May result in fewer suggestions on active practice days, but significantly improves suggestion relevance
- Helps users focus practice time on pieces that haven't been touched today
- Consistent implementation across Dashboard and Suggestions tab ensures uniform user experience

### Feature #21: ‚úÖ Enhanced Streak Emoji Progression
**Status:** Implemented  
**Date Requested:** 2025-07-22  
**Date Implemented:** 2025-07-22  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Requested By:** User Experience Team  

**Description:**  
Enhance the streak display emoji system to provide better visual progression and motivation for different milestone achievements. Currently, the fire emoji (üî•) appears at 6+ days. This should be changed to a more graduated system with multiple emoji stages that align with PlayStreak's musical theme.

**User Story:**  
As a user building my practice streak, I want to see visual progress indicators that celebrate different milestone achievements, so that I feel motivated to continue practicing and can see my progress through meaningful emoji rewards that connect to PlayStreak's musical theme.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] 0-2 days: No emoji (same as current)
- [ ] 3-4 days: Single music note emoji üéµ (same emoji used elsewhere in PlayStreak)
- [ ] 5-6 days: Double music note emoji üéµüéµ (progression within musical theme)
- [ ] 7-13 days: Single fire emoji üî• (upgraded from music notes)
- [ ] 14+ days: Triple fire emoji üî•üî•üî• (maximum achievement level)
- [ ] Emoji appears after the day count: "3 days üéµ", "5 days üéµüéµ", "7 days üî•", "14 days üî•üî•üî•"
- [ ] Proper spacing between day count and emoji
- [ ] No other display logic changes (singular/plural "day"/"days" remains the same)
- [ ] Emoji progression creates sense of achievement and motivation

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Update DashboardFragment.kt streak display logic
- Modify the conditional emoji logic from single threshold (6+ days) to multiple thresholds
- Ensure music note emoji üéµ matches the same emoji used elsewhere in the app
- Test emoji display across different Android versions and devices
- Consider emoji rendering consistency across different font systems
- Maintain existing streak calculation logic (only change display)

**Priority Justification:**  
Medium priority UX enhancement that improves user motivation and engagement through better visual feedback. The graduated emoji system provides more frequent positive reinforcement and creates stronger psychological incentive to maintain practice streaks.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Emoji Logic**: Replace single `if (streak >= 6)` condition with multiple conditions:
  ```kotlin
  val emojiSuffix = when {
      streak >= 14 -> " üî•üî•üî•"
      streak >= 7 -> " üî•" 
      streak >= 5 -> " üéµüéµ"
      streak >= 3 -> " üéµ"
      else -> ""
  }
  binding.currentStreakText.text = "$streak day${if (streak != 1) "s" else ""}$emojiSuffix"
  ```
- **Thresholds**: 3+ days (üéµ), 5+ days (üéµüéµ), 7+ days (üî•), 14+ days (üî•üî•üî•)
- **Musical Theme**: Music note emoji connects to PlayStreak branding and musical context
- **Progression**: Creates clear achievement levels with appropriate reward escalation
- **Testing**: Verify emoji rendering on various Android devices and OS versions

**Implementation Details:**

**Code Changes:**
- **DashboardFragment.kt**: Replaced simple if/else emoji logic with comprehensive when expression
- **Old Logic**: Single threshold at 6+ days for fire emoji
- **New Logic**: Four-tier progression system with multiple emoji milestones

**Emoji Progression Implementation:**
```kotlin
val emojiSuffix = when {
    streak >= 14 -> " üî•üî•üî•"  // Triple fire for elite 14+ day streaks
    streak >= 7 -> " üî•"        // Single fire for solid 7+ day streaks  
    streak >= 5 -> " üéµüéµ"      // Double music note for 5+ day momentum
    streak >= 3 -> " üéµ"        // Single music note for 3+ day achievement
    else -> ""                  // No emoji for 0-2 days
}
binding.currentStreakText.text = "$streak day${if (streak != 1) "s" else ""}$emojiSuffix"
```

### Feature #22: ‚úÖ Add PieceType to CSV Export/Import
**Status:** Implemented  
**Date Requested:** 2025-07-22  
**Date Implemented:** 2025-07-22  
**Priority:** High  
**Requested By:** Data Integrity Team  

**Description:**  
Add the PieceType field (PIECE or TECHNIQUE) to CSV export and import functionality to preserve complete piece information during data transfers. Currently, piece type information is lost during export/import cycles, requiring the system to guess whether items like "C Major Scale" should be classified as PIECE or TECHNIQUE during import.

**User Story:**  
As a user who exports and imports my practice data, I want the piece type (PIECE or TECHNIQUE) to be preserved in CSV files, so that my data maintains complete integrity without losing the distinction between musical pieces and technical exercises during import.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] CSV export includes PieceType column after Piece column
- [ ] PieceType values are exported as "PIECE" or "TECHNIQUE" (enum string values)
- [ ] CSV import validates and parses PieceType field correctly
- [ ] Import creates pieces with correct type classification
- [ ] Enhanced CSV header: `DateTime,Length,ActivityType,Piece,PieceType,Level,PerformanceType,Notes`
- [ ] Backward compatibility: Import still works with old CSV format (falls back to type detection)
- [ ] Export preserves all existing functionality while adding new field
- [ ] Import validation includes PieceType field validation with clear error messages
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new CSV format

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Update CsvHandler.exportActivitiesToCsv to include piece.type field
- Update CSV header constants to include HEADER_PIECE_TYPE
- Modify import validation to handle both old and new CSV formats
- Update importActivitiesFromCsv to parse and validate PieceType field
- Ensure ImportedActivity data class includes pieceType field
- Add validation for PieceType enum values during import
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing CSV files
- Update error messages to include PieceType validation failures

**Priority Justification:**  
High priority data integrity fix that prevents data loss during export/import cycles. Currently, users lose piece type classification when exporting and re-importing data, requiring manual re-classification or relying on imperfect keyword detection. This is a fundamental data preservation issue that affects the reliability of the backup/restore functionality.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Export Enhancement**: Add piece.type.toString() to CSV row data
  ```kotlin
  val row = listOf(
      datetime,
      activity.minutes.toString(),
      activity.activityType.toString(),
      TextNormalizer.normalizePieceName(piece.name),
      piece.type.toString(), // New field
      activity.level.toString(),
      activity.performanceType,
      TextNormalizer.normalizeUserInput(activity.notes)
  )
  ```
- **Header Update**: Add HEADER_PIECE_TYPE constant and include in header array
- **Import Enhancement**: Parse PieceType field with validation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Check CSV column count to handle old vs new format
- **Data Class Update**: Add pieceType field to ImportedActivity
- **Validation**: Ensure PieceType is valid ItemType enum value

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/utils/CsvHandler.kt`

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Feature addresses critical data integrity issue where piece type information is lost during export/import
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing CSV files through format detection
- Enhances the reliability of PlayStreak's backup and restore functionality
- Prevents users from having to manually re-classify pieces after import
- Eliminates reliance on imperfect keyword-based type detection during import

### Feature #23: ‚úÖ Include Techniques in Pieces Tab with Emoji Indicator
**Status:** Implemented  
**Date Requested:** 2025-07-22  
**Date Implemented:** 2025-07-22  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Requested By:** User Experience Team  

**Description:**  
Modify the Pieces tab to display both pieces AND techniques in a unified view, with a visual emoji indicator to distinguish techniques from regular pieces. Currently, the Pieces tab only shows items of type PIECE, but users should be able to see and manage their techniques (scales, exercises, etc.) in the same interface.

**User Story:**  
As a user managing my practice repertoire, I want to see both my pieces and techniques in the Pieces tab, so that I have a complete view of all my practice materials in one place, with clear visual distinction between pieces and technical exercises.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Pieces tab displays both PIECE and TECHNIQUE items in the same list
- [ ] Techniques show a visual emoji indicator next to their title
- [ ] Pieces continue to display without technique emoji (maintain current appearance)
- [ ] Technique emoji should be consistent with PlayStreak's visual theme
- [ ] Sort functionality works correctly with mixed piece/technique list
- [ ] Search/filter functionality works with both types
- [ ] All existing functionality (favorites, quick-add, navigation) works for both types
- [ ] Tab title remains "Pieces" but content includes techniques
- [ ] Techniques are visually distinguishable but integrated seamlessly
- [ ] Activity counts and last practice dates work for both types

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Update PiecesViewModel to query both PIECE and TECHNIQUE types instead of filtering to PIECE only
- Modify piece list item layout or adapter to conditionally display technique emoji
- Determine appropriate emoji for techniques (üéº, üéπ, ‚öôÔ∏è, or other music-related emoji)
- Ensure sorting algorithms work correctly with mixed item types
- Update any hardcoded filters that assume only PIECE type in Pieces tab
- Consider whether techniques should be grouped separately or fully integrated
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing piece-focused functionality

**Priority Justification:**  
Medium priority UX enhancement that provides users with a more complete and unified view of their practice materials. Currently, techniques are somewhat hidden or less accessible, but they are an important part of practice routines. This improves discoverability and management of technical exercises.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **ViewModel Update**: Change filter from `.filter { it.type == ItemType.PIECE }` to include both types
- **Visual Indicator**: Add conditional emoji display in adapter:
  ```kotlin
  // In PiecesAdapter ViewHolder
  val displayName = if (piece.type == ItemType.TECHNIQUE) {
      "üéº ${piece.name}"  // Or chosen technique emoji
  } else {
      piece.name
  }
  binding.pieceNameText.text = displayName
  ```
- **Emoji Selection**: Choose from music-related options:
  - üéº (musical score - indicates written exercises)
  - üéπ (piano - indicates piano techniques)  
  - ‚öôÔ∏è (gear - indicates technical exercises)
  - üîß (wrench - indicates "technique work")
- **Sorting Compatibility**: Ensure existing sort options work with mixed types
- **Testing**: Verify all piece-related functionality works with techniques

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/PiecesViewModel.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/PiecesAdapter.kt`
- Possibly `app/src/main/res/layout/item_piece_stats.xml` if emoji needs special styling

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Feature creates a more unified and complete practice materials management interface
- Maintains clear visual distinction between pieces and techniques while integrating them
- Improves discoverability of techniques that may currently be less accessible
- Preserves all existing functionality while expanding scope to include techniques
- Choice of emoji should align with PlayStreak's musical theme and be easily recognizable

### Feature #24: ‚úÖ Add Technique Emoji to Timeline and Inactive Tab
**Status:** Implemented  
**Date Requested:** 2025-07-22  
**Date Implemented:** 2025-07-22  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Requested By:** User Experience Team  

**Description:**  
Add the technique emoji indicator (üéº) next to technique names in both the Timeline and Inactive tabs to maintain visual consistency across the app. This ensures that techniques are clearly distinguished from pieces throughout all interfaces, not just in the Pieces tab.

**User Story:**  
As a user viewing my activity timeline or inactive items, I want to easily distinguish between pieces and techniques at a glance, so that I can quickly understand what type of practice material each activity involved without having to rely on memory or naming conventions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Timeline tab shows technique emoji (üéº) next to technique names in activity entries
- [ ] Inactive tab shows technique emoji (üéº) next to technique names in the pieces list
- [ ] Regular pieces continue to display without emoji in both tabs
- [ ] Emoji placement is consistent with Pieces tab implementation (before the name)
- [ ] Timeline activity formatting maintains readability with emoji addition
- [ ] Inactive tab list formatting maintains readability with emoji addition
- [ ] All existing functionality (navigation, quick-add, sorting) works unchanged
- [ ] Emoji rendering is consistent across all tabs (Timeline, Inactive, Pieces)
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (emoji added at display time, not stored)

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Update TimelineAdapter to conditionally display emoji for techniques
- Update AbandonedAdapter (Inactive tab) to conditionally display emoji for techniques
- Ensure consistent emoji choice (üéº) across all implementations
- Modify piece name display logic in both adapters
- Consider caching piece type information to avoid repeated database queries
- Test emoji rendering consistency across different Android versions
- Verify that emoji doesn't interfere with existing text truncation or styling

**Priority Justification:**  
Medium priority UX consistency enhancement that extends the visual distinction system from Feature #23 across the entire app. Provides uniform user experience and reduces cognitive load when scanning through practice history or inactive items.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Timeline Adapter**: Update activity display to include emoji for techniques:
  ```kotlin
  // In TimelineAdapter ViewHolder
  val pieceName = if (pieceOrTechnique.type == ItemType.TECHNIQUE) {
      "üéº ${pieceOrTechnique.name}"
  } else {
      pieceOrTechnique.name
  }
  // Use pieceName in activity display string
  ```
- **Inactive Adapter**: Update piece name display to include emoji for techniques:
  ```kotlin
  // In AbandonedAdapter ViewHolder  
  val displayName = if (item.piece.type == ItemType.TECHNIQUE) {
      "üéº ${item.piece.name}"
  } else {
      item.piece.name
  }
  binding.pieceNameText.text = displayName
  ```
- **Consistency**: Use same emoji (üéº) and placement pattern across all tabs
- **Performance**: Add emoji at display time, not stored in database

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/TimelineAdapter.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/AbandonedAdapter.kt`

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Feature provides visual consistency across all tabs where pieces/techniques are displayed
- Maintains same emoji choice (üéº) and placement pattern established in Feature #23
- Enhances user ability to quickly scan and understand practice material types
- No data model changes required - purely a display enhancement
- Should be implemented after or alongside Feature #23 for consistency
- Improves overall app cohesion and user experience through consistent visual language

**Dependencies:**
- Should align with emoji choice made in Feature #23 (Pieces tab technique emoji)
- Consider implementing together with Feature #23 for consistent rollout

### Feature #25: ‚úÖ Import/Export Button Label Updates and Free User Access
**Status:** Implemented  
**Date Requested:** 2025-07-22  
**Date Implemented:** 2025-07-22  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Requested By:** User Interface Team  

**Description:**  
Update the import/export UI to provide clearer button labeling and remove unnecessary feature gating for free users on the import functionality. The export button should be renamed to "Export Activities to CSV" and the import button to "Import Activities from CSV" for better clarity. Additionally, free users should have access to the same import button as Pro users, removing the current disabled/different import button behavior.

**User Story:**  
As a user, I want clear and descriptive button labels so that I understand exactly what each action will do, and as a free user, I want access to import functionality without being shown disabled buttons that create confusion about available features.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Export button text changed from current label to "Export Activities to CSV"
- [ ] Import button text changed from current label to "Import Activities from CSV"  
- [ ] Free users see the same enabled import button as Pro users
- [ ] Remove any code that shows disabled/different import buttons for free users
- [ ] Import functionality works identically for both free and Pro users
- [ ] Export functionality continues to work unchanged (only button label changes)
- [ ] UI layout and styling remain consistent with current design
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing import/export logic

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Update button text resources in strings.xml or directly in layout/code
- Remove Pro user checks specifically around import button display/enablement
- Verify that import functionality doesn't have other Pro-gated features that would break
- Test both free and Pro user flows to ensure consistent behavior
- Consider if this aligns with overall monetization strategy

**Priority Justification:**  
Medium priority UX improvement that removes user confusion and provides clearer interface labeling. Removing arbitrary feature gates on import improves user experience without significantly impacting Pro value proposition, as the core differentiation should focus on other premium features.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **UI Updates**: Update button text resources for clarity
- **Feature Gate Removal**: Remove Pro user checks around import button display
- **Testing**: Verify import works consistently for both user types

**Files to Modify:**
- Import/Export fragment/activity files (likely in `ui/importexport/`)
- String resources (`res/values/strings.xml`)
- Any ProUserManager checks related to import button display

### Feature #26: ‚úÖ Update Default Export Filename Format
**Status:** Implemented  
**Date Requested:** 2025-07-22  
**Date Implemented:** 2025-07-22  
**Priority:** Low  
**Requested By:** User Interface Team  

**Description:**  
Update the default export filename format to better reflect the PlayStreak brand and clarify the export content type. The current filename uses underscores and a generic "export" label that doesn't specify what type of data is being exported. With future plans for multiple export types (pieces, favorites, etc.), the filename should be more descriptive and consistent with branding.

**User Story:**  
As a user exporting my practice data, I want the default filename to clearly indicate what type of data is being exported and maintain consistent branding, so that I can easily organize and identify my exported files.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Default export filename uses "PlayStreak" as a single word (not "play_streak")
- [ ] Filename includes "activities" to specify the export type
- [ ] Filename format supports future differentiation from other export types
- [ ] Maintains timestamp for uniqueness
- [ ] Uses consistent naming conventions with underscores as separators

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Update filename generation in ImportExportFragment
- Consider establishing naming convention pattern for future export types
- Ensure filename compatibility across different operating systems
- Maintain backward compatibility (existing functionality unchanged)

**Priority Justification:**  
Low priority cosmetic improvement that enhances user experience through clearer file identification and consistent branding. Prepares filename structure for future multiple export types.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Current Format**: `play_streak_export_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.csv`
- **New Format**: `PlayStreak_activities_export_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.csv`
- **Future Formats**: `PlayStreak_pieces_export_...`, `PlayStreak_favorites_export_...`, etc.

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/importexport/ImportExportFragment.kt`

### Feature #27: üí° Implement Piece/Technique Count Limits
**Status:** Requested  
**Date Requested:** 2025-07-22  
**Priority:** High  
**Requested By:** Free Release Team  

**Description:**  
Implement limits on the total number of pieces and techniques that users can add to the app. Free users should be limited to 50 total items (pieces + techniques combined), while Pro users can have up to 60 total items. This limit only applies to new additions - users who already have more items than the limit should be allowed to keep them but not add more.

**User Story:**  
As a system administrator, I want to limit the number of pieces and techniques users can add based on their subscription tier, so that we can maintain app performance and create differentiation between Free and Pro users while ensuring existing users aren't penalized.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Free users limited to maximum 50 pieces + techniques combined
- [ ] Pro users limited to maximum 60 pieces + techniques combined  
- [ ] Limit enforcement only applies to new piece/technique additions
- [ ] Users with existing items above the limit can keep them but cannot add more
- [ ] Clear error message when user attempts to exceed limit
- [ ] Error message should suggest Pro upgrade for Free users (when Pro is available)
- [ ] Add piece dialog should check limits before allowing submission
- [ ] Quick-add functionality should respect limits
- [ ] Import functionality should handle limits appropriately (see Investigation section)
- [ ] Limits are enforced consistently across all piece/technique creation flows

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Update AddPieceViewModel to check current count before allowing new pieces
- Add ProUserManager method to get appropriate limit for user type
- Update PianoRepository to provide current piece/technique count
- Modify all piece creation flows (manual add, quick-add, import) to respect limits
- Consider database performance for count queries
- Handle edge cases where count changes between check and insertion
- Ensure thread safety for concurrent piece additions

**Priority Justification:**  
High priority for Free release preparation. Essential for creating meaningful differentiation between Free and Pro tiers while ensuring good performance for all users. Prevents potential abuse and ensures sustainable resource usage.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Constants**: Define `FREE_USER_PIECE_LIMIT = 50` and `PRO_USER_PIECE_LIMIT = 60`
- **Validation**: Check current count before allowing new piece creation
- **User Experience**: Clear, helpful error messages with upgrade path information
- **Performance**: Efficient count queries that don't impact app performance

**Investigation Required: Import Handling**
**Issue:** How should the system handle piece/technique limits when importing CSV data?

**Scenarios to Consider:**
1. Free user imports CSV with 75 pieces - exceeds 50 piece limit
2. User already has 45 pieces, imports CSV with 20 more pieces
3. Pro user imports CSV that would exceed 60 piece limit
4. User downgrades from Pro to Free after having 55 pieces

**Recommendation:** 
Implement **Import Limit Enforcement with User Choice**:

1. **Pre-Import Validation:**
   - Count total unique pieces in CSV file
   - Compare with user's current count + import count vs limit
   - If would exceed limit, show warning dialog before import

2. **Import Options Dialog:**
   ```
   "Import Limit Warning
   
   This import contains 75 pieces, but Free users are limited to 50 pieces total.
   You currently have 30 pieces.
   
   Choose an option:
   ‚Ä¢ Import first 20 pieces (up to your limit)
   ‚Ä¢ Cancel import and upgrade to Pro for higher limits
   ‚Ä¢ Proceed anyway (existing pieces kept, new ones truncated)"
   ```

3. **Truncation Strategy:**
   - Import pieces in CSV order until limit reached
   - Log which pieces were skipped in import results
   - Allow user to see list of skipped pieces

4. **Alternative Approach:**
   - Allow import to proceed but mark excess pieces as "inactive"
   - User can choose which pieces to keep active within their limit
   - Provides more user control over which pieces are important

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/pieces/AddPieceViewModel.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/utils/ProUserManager.kt`  
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/data/repository/PianoRepository.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/QuickAddActivityDialogFragment.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/importexport/ImportExportViewModel.kt`

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Feature is critical for Free release and Pro differentiation
- Import handling requires careful UX design to avoid user frustration
- Consider phased implementation: basic limits first, import handling second
- Should integrate with existing ProUserManager architecture
- Error messages should be helpful and guide users toward solutions

### Feature #28: ‚úÖ Update Practice Suggestions Algorithm Timing
**Status:** Implemented  
**Date Requested:** 2025-07-22  
**Date Implemented:** 2025-07-22  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Requested By:** User Experience Team

**Description:**  
Update the user-facing text description of the practice suggestions algorithm to clarify the timing intervals. Change the explanation text from "favorites after 2+ days, others after 7-31 days" to "favorites after 1+ day, others after 7+ days" to better communicate the suggestion criteria to users.

**User Story:**  
As a user who practices regularly, I want to see practice suggestions more frequently so that I can maintain consistent practice on my favorite pieces and don't forget about other pieces in my repertoire for too long.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Favorite pieces appear in suggestions after 1+ day without practice (down from 2+ days)
- [ ] Non-favorite pieces appear in suggestions after 7+ days without practice
- [ ] Today exclusion logic remains unchanged (pieces practiced today are never suggested)
- [ ] Suggestion priority remains: favorites first, then non-favorites by longest time since practice
- [ ] Pro/Free suggestion count limits remain unchanged
- [ ] Dashboard suggestions follow same timing rules as Suggestions tab
- [ ] Clear suggestion reasons display updated timing ("not practiced in 1+ day" vs "not practiced in 7+ days")
- [ ] Fallback logic (least recently practiced) uses same timing thresholds

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Update SuggestionsViewModel favorite condition from 2+ days to 1+ day
- Update DashboardViewModel to match SuggestionsViewModel timing
- Modify suggestion reason text to reflect new timing
- Update any hardcoded day calculations (twoDaysAgo ‚Üí oneDayAgo, etc.)
- Ensure consistent implementation across all suggestion logic paths
- Consider impact on suggestion frequency and user experience
- Test with various practice patterns to ensure appropriate suggestion behavior

**Priority Justification:**  
Medium priority UX enhancement that makes the suggestion system more responsive and encourages more frequent practice. The shorter intervals align with daily practice habits and help users maintain momentum with their favorite pieces while ensuring other repertoire doesn't get forgotten.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Favorites Logic**: Change from `lastActivityDate < twoDaysAgo` to `lastActivityDate < oneDayAgo`
- **Non-Favorites Logic**: Implement `lastActivityDate < sevenDaysAgo` threshold for non-favorite suggestions
- **Time Calculations**: 
  ```kotlin
  val oneDayAgo = System.currentTimeMillis() - (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
  val sevenDaysAgo = System.currentTimeMillis() - (7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
  ```
- **Suggestion Reasons**: Update display text to reflect new timing intervals
- **Consistency**: Ensure both SuggestionsViewModel and DashboardViewModel use identical logic

**Current vs New Behavior:**
- **Current**: Favorites suggested after 2+ days, others suggested less frequently
- **New**: Favorites suggested after 1+ day, others suggested after 7+ days
- **Impact**: More frequent suggestions overall, better coverage of user's repertoire

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/SuggestionsViewModel.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/DashboardViewModel.kt`
- Any suggestion reason text resources or string formatting

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Feature makes suggestions more responsive to daily practice patterns
- Should encourage more consistent practice by surfacing favorites more frequently
- 7-day threshold for non-favorites prevents repertoire from being completely forgotten
- Maintains existing suggestion prioritization and limits
- Should be tested with various practice schedules to ensure good user experience
