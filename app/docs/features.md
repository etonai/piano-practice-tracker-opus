**Date Implemented:** 2025-07-21  
**Priority:** High  
**Requested By:** Business Development  

**Description:**  
Implement a Pro Mode system that differentiates between Free and Pro users, with Pro users having access to enhanced features and capabilities. This will include a global setting mechanism to track user subscription status and conditionally enable premium features throughout the app.

**User Story:**  
As a business, we want to offer premium features to Pro subscribers so that we can generate revenue while still providing value to free users, and as a Pro user, I want access to enhanced features that justify my subscription cost.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [x] Global `isProUser` setting/preference system
- [x] Pro user status detection and persistence across app sessions
- [ ] UI indicators showing Pro-only features (with upgrade prompts for free users)
- [ ] Graceful feature limiting for free users without breaking core functionality
- [ ] Pro user onboarding and feature discovery
- [x] Settings screen showing current subscription status
- [x] Feature gate system that can be easily extended for new Pro features
- [ ] Upgrade prompt system for free users attempting to access Pro features

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Implement global user preference system (`SharedPreferences` or Room database)
- Create `ProUserManager` or similar class to handle Pro status checks

  - Hidden (`View.GONE`) for free users - no need to show complex legend for simple heat map
  - Visible (`View.VISIBLE`) for Pro users - shows detailed legend for 6 different color/intensity levels
- **Pro Status Detection**: Uses `ProUserManager.isProUser()` to determine which heat map to display
- **Dynamic Updates**: Calendar and color guide refresh in `onResume()` when Pro status changes
- **Preserved Logic**: All existing Pro heat map logic maintained for Pro users

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/CalendarFragment.kt`

Hide the Switch to Pro/Free button in production builds using BuildConfig.DEBUG while keeping it visible in debug builds for testing. This ensures production users don't see testing functionality while maintaining developer/tester access to Pro status switching.

**User Story:**  
As a production user, I should not see testing buttons that allow switching between Pro and Free modes, while as a developer or tester, I want access to the Pro/Free switch button in debug builds to test different user experiences.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Switch to Pro/Free button hidden in production/release builds
- [ ] Switch to Pro/Free button visible in debug builds
- [ ] Uses BuildConfig.DEBUG to control visibility
- [ ] Button functionality unchanged when visible
- [ ] No impact on other Pro/Free differentiation logic
- [ ] Clean production UI without testing artifacts
- [ ] Easy testing access in debug builds

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Locate Switch to Pro/Free button in Settings or main interface
- Wrap button visibility with `if (BuildConfig.DEBUG)` condition
- Ensure button container/layout adjusts properly when hidden
- Maintain existing button functionality when visible
- Consider using `View.GONE` vs `View.INVISIBLE` for clean layout
- Test both debug and release build variants

**Priority Justification:**  
High priority for production release cleanliness. Testing buttons should not be visible to production users as they create confusion and expose internal functionality not intended for end users.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Visibility Control**: Use `button.visibility = if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) View.VISIBLE else View.GONE`
- **Location**: Find Switch to Pro/Free button in Settings screen or similar
- **Layout**: Ensure parent layout handles hidden button gracefully
- **Testing**: Verify button works in debug builds and is hidden in release builds
- **Clean UI**: Production users see polished interface without testing elements

### Feature #14: üí° Build Variant Default Pro Status
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented  
**Date Requested:** 2025-07-22  
**Date Implemented:** 2025-07-22  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Requested By:** Business Team  

**Description:**  
Set different default Pro status based on build variant: Free mode default for release builds (production users), Pro mode default for debug builds (developers/testers). This ensures production users get the intended Free experience while developers can easily test Pro features.

**User Story:**  
As a production user installing PlayStreak, I should automatically start with the Free experience, while as a developer or tester using debug builds, I should start with Pro access to easily test all features without manual switching.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Release builds: New installations default to Free mode (isProUser = false)
- [ ] Debug builds: New installations default to Pro mode (isProUser = true)
- [ ] ProUserManager initializes with different defaults based on BuildConfig.DEBUG
- [ ] Release builds: All Free tier limitations active from first app launch
- [ ] Debug builds: All Pro features accessible from first app launch
- [ ] Consistent experience within each build variant
- [ ] Fresh installs show appropriate UI based on build variant (release=5 tabs, debug=6 tabs)
- [ ] Existing users maintain their current Pro/Free status regardless of build variant

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Update ProUserManager initialization to use BuildConfig.DEBUG for default value
- Modify SharedPreferences default behavior to return build-variant-specific defaults
- Verify that all Pro/Free checks handle both debug and release defaults correctly
- Test fresh installation on both debug and release builds
- Ensure existing user data is not affected by changes (only impacts new installs)
- Consider that debug users may need to manually switch to Free for testing

**Priority Justification:**  
Critical priority for both production release and development efficiency. Production users must start with Free experience for proper evaluation and monetization, while developers need immediate Pro access for efficient feature testing.

**Implementation Approach:**  
- **Default Logic**: Use `BuildConfig.DEBUG ? true : false` as default Pro status for new users
- **Location**: Update ProUserManager.isProUser() method to return build-variant-specific defaults
- **Existing Users**: Preserve current Pro/Free status in SharedPreferences
- **Testing**: Verify debug builds start Pro, release builds start Free
- **ProUserManager Default**: Ensure `isProUser()` returns `false` when no preference exists
- **SharedPreferences**: Use `getBoolean(KEY_IS_PRO_USER, false)` with explicit false default
- **Fresh Install Testing**: Verify new installations show Free tier behavior
- **User Migration**: Ensure existing users (if any) maintain current status
- **Consistency Check**: All Pro/Free logic should assume Free by default

### Feature #15: üí° Add "Add Piece (#)" Button to Settings Page
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented  
**Date Requested:** 2025-07-22  
**Date Implemented:** 2025-07-22  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Requested By:** UI/UX Team  

**Description:**  
Add an "Add Piece" button to the Settings page positioned right after the "Add Activity" button. The button should display the current count of pieces in parentheses (e.g., "Add Piece (12)") to provide users with quick access to piece management and visibility into their repertoire size.

**User Story:**  
As a user, I want quick access to add new pieces from the Settings page and see at a glance how many pieces are in my repertoire, so that I can easily manage my practice library and understand the scope of my collection.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] "Add Piece" button added to Settings page after "Add Activity" button
- [ ] Button shows current piece count in parentheses format: "Add Piece (12)"
- [ ] Piece count updates dynamically when pieces are added/removed
- [ ] Button navigates to Add Piece screen/functionality
- [ ] Consistent styling with existing Settings page buttons
- [ ] Count reflects actual number of pieces in user's library
- [ ] Real-time count updates when returning to Settings page

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Add button to Settings page layout after Add Activity button
- Query repository to get current piece count
- Use LiveData or similar to observe piece count changes
- Navigate to appropriate Add Piece screen when clicked
- Ensure count updates when user returns from adding/removing pieces
- Consider performance impact of frequent count queries
- Handle zero pieces case gracefully ("Add Piece (0)")

**Priority Justification:**  
Medium priority UI enhancement that improves user experience by providing quick access to piece management and useful repertoire size information. Helps users understand and manage their practice library more effectively.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Button Placement**: Add after existing Add Activity button in Settings layout
- **Count Query**: Use repository to get piece count with `repository.getAllPiecesAndTechniques().count { it.type == ItemType.PIECE }`
- **Dynamic Updates**: Observe piece data changes with LiveData
- **Navigation**: Navigate to Add Piece screen (create if doesn't exist)
- **Styling**: Match existing Settings page button design
- **Performance**: Cache count or use efficient query for real-time updates

### Feature #16: üí° Set Application Limits for Activities and Pieces
**Status:** Requested  
**Date Requested:** 2025-07-22  
**Priority:** High  
**Requested By:** Engineering/QA Team  

**Description:**  
Investigate and establish reasonable limits for the number of activities that can be created per day and the total number of pieces the app can hold. Implement these limits with proper validation and user feedback to ensure stable app performance and prevent edge cases that could cause crashes or poor performance.

**User Story:**  
As a user, I want the app to function reliably even with extensive use, and as a developer, I want to ensure the app has tested, guaranteed performance limits rather than unknown breaking points that could cause crashes or poor user experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Research and determine reasonable daily activity limits (e.g., 50-100 activities per day)
- [ ] Research and determine reasonable total piece limits (e.g., 500-1000 pieces)
- [ ] Test app performance at determined limits to ensure stability
- [ ] Implement validation to prevent exceeding limits
- [ ] Provide clear user feedback when approaching/hitting limits
- [ ] Graceful handling when limits are reached (no crashes)
- [ ] Document limits for user support, troubleshooting, and testing documentation
- [ ] Consider different limits for Free vs Pro users if applicable

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Performance testing with large datasets (database queries, UI rendering, memory usage)
- Database performance with thousands of activities and hundreds of pieces
- UI responsiveness with large lists (RecyclerView performance, pagination)
- Memory usage analysis under heavy data loads
- Export/import performance with maximum data sets
- Search and filtering performance with large datasets
- Calendar rendering with many activities per day

**Priority Justification:**  
High priority for app stability and user trust. Having undefined limits creates risk of crashes, poor performance, and bad user experience. Professional apps should have tested, documented limits to ensure reliability.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Research Phase**: Performance testing with synthetic large datasets
- **Limit Determination**: Based on testing results and user research
- **Validation**: Add checks when creating activities/pieces
- **User Feedback**: Clear messages like "Daily activity limit reached (50/50)"
- **Graceful Degradation**: Disable add buttons/show alternative options when limits reached
- **Documentation**: Include limits in user guide, support materials, and testing documentation
- **Monitoring**: Track usage patterns to validate limit appropriateness

**Suggested Research Areas:**
- Database performance with 10,000+ activities and 1,000+ pieces
- Calendar view rendering with 50+ activities per day
- Suggestions algorithm performance with large datasets
- Export file size and generation time limits
- Memory usage patterns under maximum load

### Feature #17: üí° Disable Import From CSV Button for Free Users
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented  
**Date Requested:** 2025-07-22  
**Date Implemented:** 2025-07-22  
**Priority:** High  
**Requested By:** Business Team  

**Description:**  
Disable the Import From CSV button functionality for Free users while keeping it enabled for Pro users. This creates a clear Pro/Free differentiation for advanced data management features while maintaining export functionality for all users to ensure data portability.

**User Story:**  
As a Free user, I should not have access to CSV import functionality, while as a Pro user, I want full data import capabilities so that I can manage my practice data comprehensively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Free users: Import From CSV button disabled/grayed out
- [ ] Pro users: Import From CSV button fully functional
- [ ] Button visual state reflects availability (enabled/disabled styling)
- [ ] Clicking disabled button shows appropriate message (not "Coming Soon")
- [ ] Export functionality remains available to all users
- [ ] Pro/Free status changes update button state immediately
- [ ] Consistent with other Pro/Free feature differentiations

**Technical Considerations:**  
- Update ImportExportFragment to check Pro status for import button state
- Modify button click behavior based on Pro/Free status
- Ensure button styling reflects enabled/disabled state (alpha, colors)
- Replace "Coming Soon" message with Pro feature prompt for consistency
- Test button state changes when Pro status toggles
- Maintain export functionality for all users (data portability)

**Priority Justification:**  
High priority for establishing clear Pro/Free feature boundaries. Import functionality is an advanced data management feature that should be restricted to Pro users while ensuring all users can export their data.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Button State**: Use `button.isEnabled = proUserManager.isProUser()` for import button
- **Visual Styling**: Apply appropriate alpha/styling for disabled state
- **Click Behavior**: Show Pro upgrade prompt when disabled button is clicked
- **Dynamic Updates**: Update button state when Pro status changes in onResume()
- **User Experience**: Clear visual distinction between enabled/disabled states
