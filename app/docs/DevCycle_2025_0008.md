### Phase 4: Hide Favorite Toggle When Maximum Favorites Reached
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-28  
**Date Completed:** 2025-07-29  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** In the Add Piece screen, hide the "Mark as Favorite" toggle and its description when the user has already reached the maximum number of favorites allowed.

**Research Findings:**
- **🎯 EXISTING FAVORITES LIMIT FOUND**: Free users limited to 4 favorites (Feature #5 - implemented)
- **Limit Constant Location**: `ProUserManager.FREE_USER_FAVORITE_LIMIT = 4` in `ProUserManager.kt:102`
- **Add Piece Screen Location**: `fragment_add_piece.xml` (lines 84-92)
- **Favorite Toggle**: `SwitchMaterial` with ID `favoriteSwitch` and text "Mark as Favorite"
- **Current Limit Implementation**: 
  - Free users: Maximum `FREE_USER_FAVORITE_LIMIT` favorites (currently 4)
  - Pro users: Unlimited favorites
  - Existing system shows upgrade prompt when Free users try to add beyond limit
- **Business Rules** (from Feature #5):
  - Free users cannot add new favorites if they already have 4 or more
  - Removing favorites always allowed for all users
  - Existing Free users with >4 favorites can keep them but cannot add new ones
- **Implementation Requirements**:
  - Use `ProUserManager.FREE_USER_FAVORITE_LIMIT` constant (currently 4) for Free user limit
  - Check current favorites count against `FREE_USER_FAVORITE_LIMIT` (not hardcoded 4)
  - Hide `favoriteSwitch` when Free user has reached the limit from constant
  - Add explanatory text when toggle is hidden (consistent with existing upgrade prompts)
  - Pro users see toggle regardless of current count (unlimited favorites)
  - Ensure favorites management still works in other screens
  - **Dynamic Limit**: Use the constant so limit can change without code updates

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Research Add Piece screen layout and Mark as Favorite toggle implementation
- [x] Define maximum favorites limit (research existing limit or establish new limit)
- [x] Implement logic to check current favorites count against maximum
- [x] Hide favorite toggle and description when maximum is reached
- [x] Add appropriate user feedback when maximum favorites limit is reached
- [x] Verify Add Piece functionality remains intact for non-favorite pieces

### Phase 5: Fix Suggestions Update Bug After Adding Activity from Suggestions Tab
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-29  
**Date Completed:** 2025-07-30  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Fix bug where adding an activity from the Suggestions tab doesn't properly update the suggestions list and Pieces tab Practice Statistics. The suggestions should change when a piece is practiced (removing that piece and showing new suggestions), and the Pieces tab should show updated "last practice" dates.

**Bug Analysis:**
- **User Report**: Activities added via Suggestions tab don't update suggestions list or Pieces tab statistics
- **Expected Behavior**: Adding activity should update piece's last practice date and refresh suggestions
- **Current Behavior**: Suggestions remain unchanged, Pieces tab shows outdated "last practice" information

**Technical Analysis:**
- **Activity Addition Flows**: Both normal and suggestions flows call `repository.insertActivity()` correctly
- **Repository Method**: `insertActivity()` properly calls `updatePieceStatistics(pieceId)` for both flows
- **Statistics Update**: `updatePieceStatistics()` correctly calculates and updates piece fields:
  - `lastPracticeDate` = most recent practice timestamp
  - `secondLastPracticeDate` = second most recent practice timestamp  
  - `lastPerformanceDate` = most recent performance timestamp
- **Suggestions Algorithm**: `SuggestionsService` relies on piece statistics fields (`piece.lastPracticeDate`, `piece.lastPerformanceDate`) for determining suggestions
- **Pieces Tab Display**: `PiecesViewModel` uses piece statistics (`piece.lastPracticeDate`, `piece.lastPerformanceDate`) for "Last:" display

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Architecture**: Both flows call same `repository.insertActivity()` method which calls `updatePieceStatistics()`
- **Key Difference**: Coroutine scope and lifecycle issue
- **Dashboard Flow**: Uses `viewModelScope.launch` in `AddActivityViewModel` - not tied to UI lifecycle
- **Suggestions Flow**: Used `lifecycleScope.launch` in dialog → `suspend fun addActivity()` - tied to dialog lifecycle
- **Root Cause**: Dialog lifecycle cancelling coroutine before database operations complete
  - `QuickAddActivityDialogFragment` calls `viewModel.addActivity()` in `lifecycleScope.launch`
  - Dialog dismissal cancels the `lifecycleScope`, which cancels the running coroutine
  - `repository.insertActivity()` gets interrupted before `updatePieceStatistics()` can run
  - **Log Evidence**: "Job was cancelled" error in QuickAddActivityViewModel

**Solution Implemented:**
- **GlobalScope Coroutine**: Changed `QuickAddActivityViewModel.addActivity()` to use `GlobalScope.launch` instead of `viewModelScope.launch`
- **Root Cause**: Dialog lifecycle was cancelling `viewModelScope` when dialog dismissed, preventing database operations from completing
- **Fix**: `GlobalScope` isn't tied to dialog lifecycle, allowing database operations to complete even after dialog dismisses

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Analyze complete activity addition flows for both suggestions and normal paths
- [x] Identify specific cause of statistics update failure (dialog dismissal timing)
- [x] Implement fix to ensure piece statistics update before dialog dismissal
- [x] Verify suggestions refresh properly after adding activity from suggestions tab
- [x] Verify Pieces tab shows updated "last practice" dates immediately  
- [x] Test that database transaction completes before UI updates
- [x] Test both scenarios (suggestions tab and normal activity addition) work identically

### Phase 6: Fix Lifetime Activities Count Bug on Activity Deletion
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-30  
**Date Completed:** 2025-07-30  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Fix bug where deleting an activity in the calendar correctly decreases the Stored Activities count but fails to decrease the Lifetime Activities count. The Lifetime Activities count should represent the cumulative total of activities ever created, so it should decrease when activities are permanently deleted.

**Bug Analysis:**
- **User Report**: Deleting activities reduces Stored Activities count but not Lifetime Activities count
- **Expected Behavior**: Both Stored Activities and Lifetime Activities counts should decrease when activity is deleted
- **Current Behavior**: Only Stored Activities count decreases, Lifetime Activities count remains unchanged
- **Impact**: Lifetime Activities count becomes inaccurate over time as deletions accumulate

**Technical Analysis:**
- **Activity Deletion Flow**: Activities deleted through calendar interface → repository deletion methods
- **Counter Management**: `ConfigurationManager` handles both stored and lifetime activity counts
- **Stored Activities**: Calculated dynamically from database (decreases correctly on deletion)
- **Lifetime Activities**: Maintained as persistent counter (may not be decremented on deletion)

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Activity Addition Flow**: `PianoRepository.insertActivity()` calls `configurationManager.incrementLifetimeActivityCount(1)` on line 105
- **Activity Deletion Flow**: `PianoRepository.deleteActivity()` does **NOT** call any lifetime counter decrement method
- **Missing Method**: `ConfigurationManager` has `incrementLifetimeActivityCount()` but **no `decrementLifetimeActivityCount()` method exists**
- **Deletion Interfaces**: Both `CalendarViewModel.deleteActivity()` and `TimelineViewModel.deleteActivity()` call `repository.deleteActivity()`

**Code Analysis:**
```kotlin
// ✅ INSERTION (increments lifetime counter)
suspend fun insertActivity(activity: Activity) {
    activityDao.insert(activity)
    configurationManager.incrementLifetimeActivityCount(1)  // ✅ Increments
    updatePieceStatistics(activity.pieceOrTechniqueId)
}

// ❌ USER DELETION (missing lifetime counter decrement) 
suspend fun deleteActivity(activity: Activity) {
    val pieceId = activity.pieceOrTechniqueId
    activityDao.delete(activity)                           // ✅ Removes from DB
    updatePieceStatistics(pieceId)                         // ✅ Updates piece stats
    // ❌ MISSING: configurationManager.decrementLifetimeActivityCount(1)
}

// ✅ DATA PRUNING (correctly preserves lifetime count)
suspend fun deleteActivitiesWithoutStatsUpdate(activityIds: List<Long>): Int {
    return activityDao.deleteActivitiesByIds(activityIds)  // ✅ Only removes from DB
    // ✅ CORRECT: No lifetime counter change (pruning != user deletion)
}
```

**ConfigurationManager Gap:**
- Has: `incrementLifetimeActivityCount(increment: Int = 1)`
- Missing: `decrementLifetimeActivityCount(decrement: Int = 1)`

**Impact:**
- Stored Activities count = `activityDao.getActivityCount()` (correct, reflects database)
- Lifetime Activities count = persistent counter (incorrect, only increments, never decrements)

**Critical Distinction - Two Types of Deletion:**
1. **User Deletion** (Calendar/Timeline): Should decrement lifetime counter (user consciously removing activities)
2. **Data Pruning**: Should NOT change lifetime counter (automatic cleanup, activities were genuinely created)

**Current Behavior Analysis:**
- ✅ **Data Pruning**: Uses `deleteActivitiesWithoutStatsUpdate()` - correctly preserves lifetime count
- ❌ **User Deletion**: Uses `deleteActivity()` - incorrectly fails to decrement lifetime count
- **Result**: Both stored count decreases, but only user deletions should affect lifetime count

**Solution Implemented:**
1. ✅ **Added Missing Method**: Created `decrementLifetimeActivityCount(decrement: Int = 1)` in `ConfigurationManager`
   - Includes safety check: `maxOf(0, current - decrement)` to prevent negative values
2. ✅ **Updated Repository**: Modified `PianoRepository.deleteActivity()` to call `configurationManager.decrementLifetimeActivityCount(1)`
3. ✅ **Preserved Pruning**: Left `deleteActivitiesWithoutStatsUpdate()` unchanged (correctly preserves lifetime count)
4. ✅ **Maintained Consistency**: Ensured symmetry between insertion and deletion flows for user actions only

**Files Modified:**
- `ConfigurationManager.kt`: Added `decrementLifetimeActivityCount()` method
- `PianoRepository.kt`: Updated `deleteActivity()` to decrement lifetime counter

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Research activity deletion flow in calendar interface
- [x] Identify where lifetime counter should be decremented during deletion  
- [x] Analyze root cause and document missing decrement functionality
- [x] Implement `decrementLifetimeActivityCount()` method in `ConfigurationManager`
- [x] Update `PianoRepository.deleteActivity()` to decrement lifetime counter
- [x] Verify both Stored and Lifetime Activities counts decrease correctly on USER deletion
- [x] Verify Lifetime Activities count is PRESERVED during data pruning
- [x] Test deletion from different interfaces (calendar, timeline, etc.)
- [x] Test data pruning does not affect lifetime counter
- [x] Ensure counter consistency is maintained across all deletion scenarios

### Phase 7: Research Practice Suggestions Count Bug  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-30  
**Date Completed:** 2025-07-29  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Research bug where Practice Suggestions sometimes shows 9 non-favorite suggestions instead of the expected count. This occurs in both Dashboard and Suggestions tab, suggesting a common underlying issue in the suggestions algorithm.

**Bug Analysis:**
- **User Report**: Free user sometimes seeing 9 non-favorite suggestions in Practice Suggestions (Dashboard and Suggestions tab)
- **Expected Behavior**: Free users should see maximum 1 favorite + 2 non-favorites = **3 total practice suggestions**
- **Current Behavior**: Free user occasionally displays 9 non-favorite suggestions
- **Scope**: Affects both Dashboard and Suggestions tab (shared suggestions source)
- **Severity**: Critical - exceeds expected limits by 300% for Free users

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Shared Source**: Both Dashboard and Suggestions tab use `SuggestionsService.generateAllSuggestions()` 
- **Algorithm Structure**: Combines practice suggestions + performance suggestions
- **Practice Suggestions Limits**: 
  - Free users: Up to 1 favorite + up to 2 non-favorites = **3 total**
  - Pro users: Up to 4 favorites + up to 4 non-favorites = **8 total**
- **Performance Suggestions**: Pro users get up to 5 additional (Free users get 0)
- **Expected for Free Users**: Maximum 3 practice suggestions total
- **Actual Bug**: Free user seeing 9 non-favorite suggestions (impossible under correct algorithm)

**The "9 Suggestions" Bug Source:**
Looking at `SuggestionsService.generatePracticeSuggestions()` lines 302 and 305:
```kotlin
// Determine non-favorite limit based on Pro status
val nonFavoriteLimit = if (proUserManager.isProUser()) 4 else 2

// Always aim for up to limit non-favorites total  
val finalNonFavoriteSuggestions = if (nonFavoriteSuggestions.size < nonFavoriteLimit) {
```

**Critical Code Quality Issue - Hardcoded Magic Numbers Throughout:**
The suggestions limits are hardcoded in multiple locations in `SuggestionsService.kt`:
- Line 50: `if (proUserManager.isProUser()) 4 else 1` ❌ 
- Line 161: `.take(5)` ❌
- Line 236: `if (proUserManager.isProUser()) 4 else 1` ❌ (duplicate)
- Line 302: `if (proUserManager.isProUser()) 4 else 2` ❌

**Impact of Hardcoded Numbers:**
- Makes the code unmaintainable (same numbers repeated)
- Increases risk of bugs when limits need to change
- Makes the algorithm logic unclear 
- Current bug partly caused by inconsistent hardcoded limits

**All Numbers Must Be Named Constants:** Every magic number should be replaced with descriptive constants that clearly indicate their purpose and relationship to user types.

**Critical Bug for Free Users - 9 Non-Favorite Suggestions:**
Since this affects a **Free user**, the 9 non-favorite suggestions represent a serious algorithm failure:

**Impossible Under Correct Logic:**
- Free users should get: 1 favorite + 2 non-favorites = 3 total practice suggestions
- Free users get 0 performance suggestions 
- **Maximum possible for Free user: 3 suggestions**
- **Actual bug: 9 suggestions = 300% over limit**

**Possible Algorithm Failures:**
1. **Pro User Check Failure**: `proUserManager.isProUser()` returning incorrect value
2. **Fallback Logic Bug**: Fallback mechanism not respecting Free user limits
3. **Loop/Accumulation Bug**: Algorithm adding suggestions multiple times
4. **Performance Suggestions Leak**: Performance suggestions being shown to Free users
5. **Constants Confusion**: Wrong constants being used for Free user limits

**Code Flow Analysis:**
- `generateAllSuggestions()` → `generatePracticeSuggestions()` + `generatePerformanceSuggestions()` 
- Practice suggestions: Up to 4 favorites + 4 non-favorites (Pro users)
- Performance suggestions: Up to 5 additional (Pro users only)
- **Issue**: No overall total limit applied after combining suggestion types

**Key Findings:**
- **Files Analyzed**: `SuggestionsService.kt`, `DashboardViewModel.kt`, `SuggestionsViewModel.kt`
- **Algorithm Limits**: Pro users can get 4 favorites + 4 non-favorites + 5 performance = up to 13 total
- **No Overall Limit**: `generateAllSuggestions()` simply concatenates practice + performance suggestions
- **Intermittent Nature**: Depends on user's piece data and recent activity patterns

**Critical Investigation Needed:**
Since a **Free user** is experiencing this bug, this indicates a fundamental failure in the suggestions algorithm:

**Free User Should Never See:**
- More than 1 favorite suggestion
- More than 2 non-favorite suggestions  
- Any performance suggestions
- More than 3 total suggestions

**9 non-favorite suggestions = Complete algorithm breakdown**

**CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED IN CODE ANALYSIS:**

**Root Cause Found in `SuggestionsService.generateAllSuggestions()` lines 50-58:**
```kotlin
// Apply favorite limits across all suggestion types
val finalFavoriteLimit = if (proUserManager.isProUser()) 4 else 1
val favoriteSuggestionsInAll = allSuggestions.filter { it.piece.isFavorite }
val nonFavoriteSuggestionsInAll = allSuggestions.filter { !it.piece.isFavorite }

// Limit favorites to user limit and preserve order
val limitedFavorites = favoriteSuggestionsInAll.take(finalFavoriteLimit)
val limitedNonFavorites = nonFavoriteSuggestionsInAll  // ❌ NO LIMIT APPLIED!

return limitedFavorites + limitedNonFavorites
```

**THE BUG:** Line 56 shows `limitedNonFavorites = nonFavoriteSuggestionsInAll` with **NO `.take()` limit applied!**

**Analysis:**
- ✅ **Favorites are limited**: `favoriteSuggestionsInAll.take(finalFavoriteLimit)` 
- ❌ **Non-favorites are unlimited**: `nonFavoriteSuggestionsInAll` returns ALL non-favorite suggestions
- **Result**: Free users get 1 favorite + unlimited non-favorites instead of 1 favorite + 2 non-favorites

**Detailed Code Flow Analysis:**

**1. ProUserManager Check (✅ Working Correctly):**
- `ProUserManager.isProUser()` returns `sharedPreferences.getBoolean(KEY_IS_PRO_USER, false)`
- Defaults to `false` for Free users - this appears correct

**2. Individual Suggestion Generation (✅ Respects Limits, ❌ Uses Hardcoded Numbers):**
- `generatePracticeSuggestions()` limits Free users but uses magic numbers:
  - Line 236: `val favoriteLimit = if (proUserManager.isProUser()) 4 else 1` ❌ Hardcoded
  - Line 302: `val nonFavoriteLimit = if (proUserManager.isProUser()) 4 else 2` ❌ Hardcoded
- `generatePerformanceSuggestions()` correctly returns empty list for Free users (line 69-71)

**3. Final Combination Logic (❌ MULTIPLE BUGS HERE):**
- `generateAllSuggestions()` combines practice + performance suggestions  
- **Lines 50 & 55-56**: More hardcoded numbers and missing non-favorite limits:
```kotlin
val finalFavoriteLimit = if (proUserManager.isProUser()) 4 else 1  // ❌ Hardcoded
val limitedFavorites = favoriteSuggestionsInAll.take(finalFavoriteLimit)
val limitedNonFavorites = nonFavoriteSuggestionsInAll  // ❌ NO LIMIT APPLIED
```

**How Free User Gets 9 Non-Favorite Suggestions:**
1. `generatePracticeSuggestions()` creates up to FREE_NON_FAVORITE_LIMIT non-favorite suggestions 
2. Fallback logic in practice suggestions can add more abandoned pieces (lines 305-364)
3. `generateAllSuggestions()` takes ALL non-favorites without limit (line 56)
4. Result: 0 favorites + 9 non-favorites (from practice suggestions + fallbacks)

**Constants Should Be Consolidated in ProUserManager:**

**Current User Limit Constants in `ProUserManager.kt`:**
```kotlin
const val FREE_USER_FAVORITE_LIMIT = 4                    // ✅ Already exists
private const val FREE_USER_ACTIVITY_LIMIT = 3000         // ✅ Already exists  
private const val PRO_USER_ACTIVITY_LIMIT = 4000          // ✅ Already exists
private const val FREE_USER_PIECE_LIMIT = 500             // ✅ Already exists
private const val PRO_USER_PIECE_LIMIT = 550              // ✅ Already exists
```

**Missing Suggestions Constants - Should Be Added to ProUserManager:**
```kotlin
// Add to ProUserManager companion object:
const val FREE_USER_PRACTICE_FAVORITE_SUGGESTIONS = 1
const val PRO_USER_PRACTICE_FAVORITE_SUGGESTIONS = 4
const val FREE_USER_PRACTICE_NON_FAVORITE_SUGGESTIONS = 2
const val PRO_USER_PRACTICE_NON_FAVORITE_SUGGESTIONS = 4
const val PRO_USER_PERFORMANCE_SUGGESTIONS = 5  // Free users get 0

// Calculated totals for final limits
const val FREE_USER_TOTAL_NON_FAVORITE_SUGGESTIONS = FREE_USER_PRACTICE_NON_FAVORITE_SUGGESTIONS
const val PRO_USER_TOTAL_NON_FAVORITE_SUGGESTIONS = PRO_USER_PRACTICE_NON_FAVORITE_SUGGESTIONS + PRO_USER_PERFORMANCE_SUGGESTIONS
```

**Usage in SuggestionsService:**
```kotlin
val finalFavoriteLimit = if (proUserManager.isProUser()) 
    ProUserManager.PRO_USER_PRACTICE_FAVORITE_SUGGESTIONS 
    else ProUserManager.FREE_USER_PRACTICE_FAVORITE_SUGGESTIONS
    
val finalNonFavoriteLimit = if (proUserManager.isProUser()) 
    ProUserManager.PRO_USER_TOTAL_NON_FAVORITE_SUGGESTIONS 
    else ProUserManager.FREE_USER_TOTAL_NON_FAVORITE_SUGGESTIONS

val limitedNonFavorites = nonFavoriteSuggestionsInAll.take(finalNonFavoriteLimit)
```

**Benefits of Consolidating in ProUserManager:**
- All user limits in one central location
- Consistent naming convention with existing constants
- Makes limits discoverable and maintainable
- Other classes already reference `ProUserManager` constants (e.g., `ProUserManager.FREE_USER_FAVORITE_LIMIT`)

**Solution Implemented:**

**1. ✅ Fixed Critical Bug - Missing Non-Favorite Limit:**
- **Root Cause**: `SuggestionsService.generateAllSuggestions()` line 56 had no `.take()` limit for non-favorites
- **Before**: `val limitedNonFavorites = nonFavoriteSuggestionsInAll` (unlimited)
- **After**: `val limitedNonFavorites = nonFavoriteSuggestionsInAll.take(finalNonFavoriteLimit)` (limited)

**2. ✅ Added Missing Constants to ProUserManager:**
```kotlin
// Practice Suggestions Limits
const val FREE_USER_PRACTICE_FAVORITE_SUGGESTIONS = 1
const val PRO_USER_PRACTICE_FAVORITE_SUGGESTIONS = 4
const val FREE_USER_PRACTICE_NON_FAVORITE_SUGGESTIONS = 2
const val PRO_USER_PRACTICE_NON_FAVORITE_SUGGESTIONS = 4
const val PRO_USER_PERFORMANCE_SUGGESTIONS = 5  // Free users get 0
```

**3. ✅ Replaced All Hardcoded Magic Numbers:**
- **Line 50-52**: Replaced hardcoded `4 else 1` with named constants
- **Line 161**: Replaced hardcoded `.take(5)` with `ProUserManager.PRO_USER_PERFORMANCE_SUGGESTIONS`
- **Line 236-238**: Replaced hardcoded `4 else 1` with named constants  
- **Line 302-304**: Replaced hardcoded `4 else 2` with named constants

**4. ✅ Proper Free User Limits Applied:**
- **Favorites**: Maximum 1 (from `FREE_USER_PRACTICE_FAVORITE_SUGGESTIONS`)
- **Non-Favorites**: Maximum 2 (from `FREE_USER_PRACTICE_NON_FAVORITE_SUGGESTIONS`)
- **Total**: Maximum 3 practice suggestions for Free users
- **Performance**: 0 suggestions for Free users (existing behavior preserved)

**Files Modified:**
- `ProUserManager.kt`: Added suggestion limit constants
- `SuggestionsService.kt`: Fixed missing non-favorite limit and replaced all magic numbers

**Bug Resolution:**
- ❌ **Before**: Free users could see unlimited non-favorite suggestions (up to 9+ observed)
- ✅ **After**: Free users limited to exactly 1 favorite + 2 non-favorites = 3 total suggestions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Research suggestions algorithm implementation and limits
- [x] Identify source of Practice Suggestions in Dashboard and Suggestions tab
- [x] Analyze favorite vs non-favorite suggestion logic
- [x] Document expected vs actual suggestion count behavior

### Phase 9: Fix PlayStreak Update Bug After Adding Activity from Suggestions Tab
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-29  
**Date Completed:** 2025-07-29  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Fix bug where adding the first activity of the day through the Suggestions tab does not update the PlayStreak counter. The activity is correctly added to the calendar and activity window, but the streak calculation is not triggered or updated.

**Bug Analysis:**
- **User Report**: Added first activity of the day via Suggestions tab
- **Expected Behavior**: PlayStreak should increment when first daily activity is added
- **Current Behavior**: Activity appears in calendar and activity window but PlayStreak remains unchanged
- **Impact**: Streak tracking becomes inaccurate when activities are added through suggestions

**Technical Context:**
- This appears related to the previous Phase 5 fix for suggestions tab activity addition
- Phase 5 fixed statistics updates and suggestions refresh but may have missed streak calculation
- Streak calculation likely depends on daily activity detection logic
- Both normal activity addition and suggestions tab addition should trigger identical streak updates

**Investigation Required:**
- Compare streak update logic between normal activity addition and suggestions tab flows
- Verify if streak calculation is called in QuickAddActivityViewModel.addActivity()
- Check if streak update depends on specific coroutine scope or timing
- Analyze daily activity detection logic and its integration points

**Root Cause Analysis:**

**Streak Calculation Architecture:**
- **StreakCalculator**: Utility class that calculates current streak from activity list
- **Repository Method**: `PianoRepository.calculateCurrentStreak()` fetches all activities and delegates to StreakCalculator
- **Dashboard Display**: Uses `viewLifecycleOwner.lifecycleScope.launch { viewModel.calculateStreak() }` in onViewCreated() 
- **MainFragment Display**: Uses reactive `MainViewModel.currentStreak` LiveData that observes `repository.getAllActivities()`

**Key Difference - Reactive vs Manual Updates:**
- **MainFragment**: ✅ **Reactive** - `currentStreak` LiveData automatically updates when activities change
- **Dashboard**: ❌ **Manual** - `calculateStreak()` called only once in `onViewCreated()`, never refreshes

**Critical Issue Identified:**
The Dashboard fragment uses a **one-time streak calculation** instead of reactive updates:

```kotlin
// Dashboard - PROBLEM: Only calculated once during fragment creation
viewLifecycleOwner.lifecycleScope.launch {
    val streak = viewModel.calculateStreak()  // ❌ Static calculation
    binding.currentStreakText.text = "$streak day${if (streak != 1) "s" else ""}$emojiSuffix"
}

// MainFragment - CORRECT: Reactive to database changes  
val currentStreak: LiveData<Int> = repository.getAllActivities()
    .map { activities -> streakCalculator.calculateCurrentStreak(activities) }  // ✅ Updates automatically
    .asLiveData()
```

**Why This Affects Suggestions Tab Specifically:**
- **Normal Activity Addition**: Often navigates away from Dashboard, so returning triggers onViewCreated() and streak recalculation
- **Suggestions Tab Addition**: User stays on Dashboard tab, so onViewCreated() is never called again
- **Result**: Dashboard streak remains stale until fragment is recreated

**Both Activity Addition Flows Are Identical:**
- **QuickAddActivityViewModel** (suggestions): `repository.insertActivity(activity)` 
- **AddActivityViewModel** (normal): `repository.insertActivity(activity)`
- **Repository Method**: Both call same `insertActivity()` which updates database correctly
- **Database Updates**: Activities are properly inserted and trigger Flow emissions

**The Real Problem:**
This is **NOT** a suggestions-specific bug. It's a **Dashboard UI reactivity bug** that affects any activity addition when the user remains on the Dashboard tab without navigating away.

**Evidence:**
- MainFragment shows correct reactive streak updates because it uses LiveData
- Dashboard shows stale streak because it uses one-time calculation
- The issue appears with suggestions because users typically stay on Dashboard after adding via suggestions
- Normal activity addition often involves navigation, masking the Dashboard reactivity issue

**Files Analyzed:**
- `StreakCalculator.kt`: Correct calculation logic (lines 8-59)
- `PianoRepository.kt`: Correct `calculateCurrentStreak()` implementation  
- `DashboardFragment.kt`: **Root cause** - static calculation on lines 83-93
- `MainViewModel.kt`: **Correct pattern** - reactive LiveData on lines 17-21
- `QuickAddActivityViewModel.kt`: Correct activity insertion (line 39)
- `AddActivityViewModel.kt`: Correct activity insertion (identical flow)

**Solution Implemented:**

**1. ✅ Added Reactive Streak LiveData to DashboardViewModel:**
```kotlin
val currentStreak: LiveData<Int> = repository.getAllActivities()
    .map { activities ->
        streakCalculator.calculateCurrentStreak(activities)
    }
    .asLiveData()
```

**2. ✅ Updated DashboardFragment to Use Reactive Observer:**
```kotlin
// BEFORE: Static calculation in lifecycleScope
viewLifecycleOwner.lifecycleScope.launch {
    val streak = viewModel.calculateStreak()  // ❌ One-time calculation
    binding.currentStreakText.text = "$streak day${if (streak != 1) "s" else ""}$emojiSuffix"
}

// AFTER: Reactive LiveData observer  
viewModel.currentStreak.observe(viewLifecycleOwner) { streak ->  // ✅ Reactive updates
    val emojiSuffix = when {
        streak >= 14 -> " 🔥🔥🔥"
        streak >= 8 -> " 🔥" 
        streak >= 5 -> " 🎶"
        streak >= 3 -> " 🎵"
        else -> ""
    }
    binding.currentStreakText.text = "$streak day${if (streak != 1) "s" else ""}$emojiSuffix"
}
```

**3. ✅ Architectural Consistency Achieved:**
- **Dashboard**: Now uses same reactive pattern as MainFragment
- **MainFragment**: Already had correct reactive `currentStreak` LiveData
- **Both Fragments**: Now observe `repository.getAllActivities()` changes automatically
- **Activity Addition**: Both suggestions and normal flows trigger identical reactive updates

**4. ✅ Bug Resolution:**
- ❌ **Before**: Dashboard streak only updated on fragment recreation (onViewCreated)
- ✅ **After**: Dashboard streak automatically updates when activities change in database
- **Suggestions Tab**: Now works identically to normal activity addition
- **User Experience**: Immediate streak updates regardless of activity addition method

**Files Modified:**
- `DashboardViewModel.kt`: Added reactive `currentStreak` LiveData using StreakCalculator
- `DashboardFragment.kt`: Replaced static calculation with reactive LiveData observer

**Technical Details:**
- Uses identical pattern to MainViewModel for consistency
- Observes `repository.getAllActivities()` Flow which emits on database changes
- StreakCalculator processes activity list to determine current streak
- LiveData automatically handles lifecycle-aware updates
- Removed unused lifecycleScope import after conversion

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Research streak calculation implementation and trigger points
- [x] Identify differences between normal and suggestions tab activity addition flows for streak updates
- [x] Analyze daily activity detection logic used by streak calculation
- [x] Document root cause of missing streak update in suggestions tab flow

- [x] Test that both activity addition methods produce identical streak behavior
- [x] Ensure streak calculation works for subsequent activities added through suggestions tab

### Phase 10: Fix Dashboard Activity Listing Update Delay After Deletion
**Status:** 🔄 In Progress  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-29  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Fix bug where deleted activities persist in the Dashboard "Today's Activities" listing for an extended period (30+ seconds to 1+ minute) even though the activity count correctly shows 0 and the activity is properly removed from other parts of the app.

**Bug Analysis:**
- **User Report**: After deleting a recently added activity, it remained visible in Dashboard activity listing for 30+ seconds to 1+ minute
- **Expected Behavior**: Deleted activity should immediately disappear from Dashboard activity listing
- **Current Behavior**: Activity count updates to 0 correctly, but individual activity remains visible in the list
- **Workaround**: Tab switching multiple times eventually causes the activity to disappear
- **Impact**: Poor user experience - creates confusion about whether deletion was successful

**Technical Context:**
- This appears to be a UI reactivity/data flow issue in the Dashboard
- Activity count updates correctly (suggests repository/database deletion works)
- Other parts of the app update properly (suggests deletion logic is correct)
- The delay suggests a caching, LiveData, or Flow update issue specific to Dashboard activity listing
- Tab switching eventually triggers refresh, indicating the data source is correct but UI binding may be stale

**Investigation Required:**
- Compare activity deletion flows and UI update mechanisms between Dashboard and other screens
- Analyze Dashboard activity listing data flow (LiveData/Flow subscriptions)
- Check if Dashboard caches activity data differently than other components
- Verify if there are multiple data sources or observers for Dashboard activity listing
- Investigate potential race conditions between deletion and UI updates

**Potential Root Causes:**
- Dashboard activity LiveData/Flow not properly observing repository changes
- Cached data in Dashboard ViewModel not invalidating after deletion
- Different coroutine scopes causing delayed updates in Dashboard vs other screens
- Multiple competing data sources for Dashboard activities
- UI binding not reacting to data source changes

**Root Cause Analysis:**

**Dashboard Activity Data Flow Architecture:**
- **DashboardViewModel.todayActivities**: Uses `repository.getActivitiesForDateRange(todayStart, todayEnd).combine(repository.getAllPiecesAndTechniques())` 
- **Repository Method**: `getActivitiesForDateRange()` delegates to `activityDao.getActivitiesForDateRange(startTime, endTime)`
- **DAO Method**: Returns `Flow<List<Activity>>` from Room database query
- **Data Transformation**: Combined with pieces to create `List<ActivityWithPiece>` then converted to LiveData
- **UI Binding**: Dashboard observes `viewModel.todayActivities` with `viewLifecycleOwner`

**All Components Use Identical Reactive Architecture:**
- **Dashboard**: ✅ Uses `Flow.combine().asLiveData()` - should be reactive
- **Calendar**: ✅ Uses `Flow.combine().asLiveData()` - should be reactive  
- **Timeline**: ✅ Uses `Flow.combine().asLiveData()` - should be reactive
- **Repository**: ✅ `deleteActivity()` calls `activityDao.delete()` which triggers Flow updates
- **Room DAO**: ✅ All methods return `Flow<>` that automatically emit on database changes

**Critical Finding - All Architectures Are Correct:**
The data flow architecture is **identical across all screens** and **should work reactively**. All components use:
1. Room DAO returning Flow
2. Repository combining flows 
3. ViewModel converting to LiveData
4. Fragment observing with viewLifecycleOwner

**The Issue Is NOT Architectural - It's Likely Timing/Threading:**

**Potential Root Causes:**
1. **Room Database Transaction Timing**: Database delete operation may not immediately trigger Flow emission
2. **Flow Combination Delay**: The `combine()` operation between activities and pieces may have processing delay
3. **LiveData Update Batching**: Android may batch LiveData updates causing UI delays
4. **Thread Switching Overhead**: Flow -> LiveData conversion involves thread context switching
5. **Observer Lifecycle Timing**: viewLifecycleOwner may introduce update delays during certain lifecycle states

**Why Other Screens Appear Faster:**
- **Calendar/Timeline**: User often navigates away immediately after deletion, masking any delay
- **Dashboard**: User stays on screen, making delays more noticeable
- **Activity Count vs List**: Count calculation may be faster/cached differently than full list updates

**Evidence Supporting Timing Issues:**
- User reports delay is 30+ seconds to 1+ minute (far too long for normal processing)
- Tab switching eventually triggers update (suggests data is correct, UI binding is delayed)
- Activity count updates correctly (suggests database operation succeeds)
- Architecture is reactive and identical across screens

**Investigation Required:**
The issue is likely **not** in the app architecture but in:
- Room database transaction timing and Flow emission delays
- Android Framework LiveData/Flow update batching behavior  
- Thread context switching between database, repository, and UI layers
- Potential memory pressure causing delayed garbage collection of stale UI state
