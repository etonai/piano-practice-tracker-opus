# Development Cycle 2025-0008

**Status:** In Progress  
**Start Date:** 2025-01-28  
**Focus:** Testing Build 1.0.8.22-beta

## Overview

This development cycle focuses on comprehensive testing of build 1.0.8.22-beta, which includes all the features and optimizations implemented in DevCycle 2025-0007. The cycle validates the consolidated suggestions algorithm, optimized performance using piece metadata, and enhanced user experience features before proceeding to production release.

## Current Work Items

### Phase 1: Test Build 1.0.8.22-beta
**Status:** ðŸŽ« Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-01-28  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** Conduct comprehensive testing of build 1.0.8.22-beta to validate application functionality and ensure readiness for production release.
**Build Version:** 1.0.8.22-beta
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Complete testing of build 1.0.8.22-beta

### Phase 2: Implement Yellow Star Favorites
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-01-29  
**Date Completed:** 2025-07-28  
**Build Version:** 1.0.8.23-beta  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Update the star color for favorite pieces from black/dark gray to yellow across Suggestions and Pieces tabs to match the existing Dashboard implementation.
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Update star colors to yellow in Suggestions tab for favorite pieces
- [x] Update star colors to yellow in Pieces tab for favorite pieces

- [x] Ensure consistent yellow star appearance across all tabs

### Phase 3: Hide Last Sync Information in Import/Export Screen
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-01-29  
**Date Completed:** 2025-07-28  
**Build Version:** 1.0.8.23-beta  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Hide the Last sync information in the Import/Export Data screen as the data sync functionality is still under development and not ready for user display.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Research Import/Export Data screen layout and components
- [x] Identify Last sync information display elements
- [x] Hide or remove Last sync information from the UI
- [x] Verify Import/Export screen functionality remains intact

### Phase 4: Hide Favorite Toggle When Maximum Favorites Reached
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-01-29  
**Date Completed:** 2025-07-29  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** In the Add Piece screen, hide the "Mark as Favorite" toggle and its description when the user has already reached the maximum number of favorites allowed.

**Research Findings:**
- **ðŸŽ¯ EXISTING FAVORITES LIMIT FOUND**: Free users limited to 4 favorites (Feature #5 - implemented)
- **Limit Constant Location**: `ProUserManager.FREE_USER_FAVORITE_LIMIT = 4` in `ProUserManager.kt:102`
- **Add Piece Screen Location**: `fragment_add_piece.xml` (lines 84-92)
- **Favorite Toggle**: `SwitchMaterial` with ID `favoriteSwitch` and text "Mark as Favorite"
- **Current Limit Implementation**: 
  - Free users: Maximum `FREE_USER_FAVORITE_LIMIT` favorites (currently 4)
  - Pro users: Unlimited favorites
  - Existing system shows upgrade prompt when Free users try to add beyond limit
- **Business Rules** (from Feature #5):
  - Free users cannot add new favorites if they already have 4 or more
  - Removing favorites always allowed for all users
  - Existing Free users with >4 favorites can keep them but cannot add new ones
- **Implementation Requirements**:
  - Use `ProUserManager.FREE_USER_FAVORITE_LIMIT` constant (currently 4) for Free user limit
  - Check current favorites count against `FREE_USER_FAVORITE_LIMIT` (not hardcoded 4)
  - Hide `favoriteSwitch` when Free user has reached the limit from constant
  - Add explanatory text when toggle is hidden (consistent with existing upgrade prompts)
  - Pro users see toggle regardless of current count (unlimited favorites)
  - Ensure favorites management still works in other screens
  - **Dynamic Limit**: Use the constant so limit can change without code updates

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Research Add Piece screen layout and Mark as Favorite toggle implementation
- [x] Define maximum favorites limit (research existing limit or establish new limit)
- [x] Implement logic to check current favorites count against maximum
- [x] Hide favorite toggle and description when maximum is reached
- [x] Add appropriate user feedback when maximum favorites limit is reached
- [x] Verify Add Piece functionality remains intact for non-favorite pieces

### Phase 5: Fix Suggestions Update Bug After Adding Activity from Suggestions Tab
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-29  
**Date Completed:** 2025-07-30  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Fix bug where adding an activity from the Suggestions tab doesn't properly update the suggestions list and Pieces tab Practice Statistics. The suggestions should change when a piece is practiced (removing that piece and showing new suggestions), and the Pieces tab should show updated "last practice" dates.

**Bug Analysis:**
- **User Report**: Activities added via Suggestions tab don't update suggestions list or Pieces tab statistics
- **Expected Behavior**: Adding activity should update piece's last practice date and refresh suggestions
- **Current Behavior**: Suggestions remain unchanged, Pieces tab shows outdated "last practice" information

**Technical Analysis:**
- **Activity Addition Flows**: Both normal and suggestions flows call `repository.insertActivity()` correctly
- **Repository Method**: `insertActivity()` properly calls `updatePieceStatistics(pieceId)` for both flows
- **Statistics Update**: `updatePieceStatistics()` correctly calculates and updates piece fields:
  - `lastPracticeDate` = most recent practice timestamp
  - `secondLastPracticeDate` = second most recent practice timestamp  
  - `lastPerformanceDate` = most recent performance timestamp
- **Suggestions Algorithm**: `SuggestionsService` relies on piece statistics fields (`piece.lastPracticeDate`, `piece.lastPerformanceDate`) for determining suggestions
- **Pieces Tab Display**: `PiecesViewModel` uses piece statistics (`piece.lastPracticeDate`, `piece.lastPerformanceDate`) for "Last:" display

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Architecture**: Both flows call same `repository.insertActivity()` method which calls `updatePieceStatistics()`
- **Key Difference**: Coroutine scope and lifecycle issue
- **Dashboard Flow**: Uses `viewModelScope.launch` in `AddActivityViewModel` - not tied to UI lifecycle
- **Suggestions Flow**: Used `lifecycleScope.launch` in dialog â†’ `suspend fun addActivity()` - tied to dialog lifecycle
- **Root Cause**: Dialog lifecycle cancelling coroutine before database operations complete
  - `QuickAddActivityDialogFragment` calls `viewModel.addActivity()` in `lifecycleScope.launch`
  - Dialog dismissal cancels the `lifecycleScope`, which cancels the running coroutine
  - `repository.insertActivity()` gets interrupted before `updatePieceStatistics()` can run
  - **Log Evidence**: "Job was cancelled" error in QuickAddActivityViewModel

**Solution Implemented:**
- **GlobalScope Coroutine**: Changed `QuickAddActivityViewModel.addActivity()` to use `GlobalScope.launch` instead of `viewModelScope.launch`
- **Root Cause**: Dialog lifecycle was cancelling `viewModelScope` when dialog dismissed, preventing database operations from completing
- **Fix**: `GlobalScope` isn't tied to dialog lifecycle, allowing database operations to complete even after dialog dismisses

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Analyze complete activity addition flows for both suggestions and normal paths
- [x] Identify specific cause of statistics update failure (dialog dismissal timing)
- [x] Implement fix to ensure piece statistics update before dialog dismissal
- [x] Verify suggestions refresh properly after adding activity from suggestions tab
- [x] Verify Pieces tab shows updated "last practice" dates immediately  
- [x] Test that database transaction completes before UI updates
- [x] Test both scenarios (suggestions tab and normal activity addition) work identically
