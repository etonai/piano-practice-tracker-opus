- [x] Identify Last sync information display elements
- [x] Hide or remove Last sync information from the UI
- [x] Verify Import/Export screen functionality remains intact

### Phase 4: Hide Favorite Toggle When Maximum Favorites Reached
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-01-29  
**Date Completed:** 2025-07-29  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** In the Add Piece screen, hide the "Mark as Favorite" toggle and its description when the user has already reached the maximum number of favorites allowed.

**Research Findings:**
- **🎯 EXISTING FAVORITES LIMIT FOUND**: Free users limited to 4 favorites (Feature #5 - implemented)
- **Limit Constant Location**: `ProUserManager.FREE_USER_FAVORITE_LIMIT = 4` in `ProUserManager.kt:102`
- **Add Piece Screen Location**: `fragment_add_piece.xml` (lines 84-92)
- **Favorite Toggle**: `SwitchMaterial` with ID `favoriteSwitch` and text "Mark as Favorite"
- **Current Limit Implementation**: 
  - Free users: Maximum `FREE_USER_FAVORITE_LIMIT` favorites (currently 4)
  - Pro users: Unlimited favorites
  - Existing system shows upgrade prompt when Free users try to add beyond limit
- **Business Rules** (from Feature #5):
  - Free users cannot add new favorites if they already have 4 or more
  - Removing favorites always allowed for all users
  - Existing Free users with >4 favorites can keep them but cannot add new ones
- **Implementation Requirements**:
  - Use `ProUserManager.FREE_USER_FAVORITE_LIMIT` constant (currently 4) for Free user limit
  - Check current favorites count against `FREE_USER_FAVORITE_LIMIT` (not hardcoded 4)
  - Hide `favoriteSwitch` when Free user has reached the limit from constant
  - Add explanatory text when toggle is hidden (consistent with existing upgrade prompts)
  - Pro users see toggle regardless of current count (unlimited favorites)
  - Ensure favorites management still works in other screens
  - **Dynamic Limit**: Use the constant so limit can change without code updates

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Research Add Piece screen layout and Mark as Favorite toggle implementation
- [x] Define maximum favorites limit (research existing limit or establish new limit)
- [x] Implement logic to check current favorites count against maximum
- [x] Hide favorite toggle and description when maximum is reached
- [x] Add appropriate user feedback when maximum favorites limit is reached
- [x] Verify Add Piece functionality remains intact for non-favorite pieces

### Phase 5: Fix Suggestions Update Bug After Adding Activity from Suggestions Tab
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-29  
**Date Completed:** 2025-07-30  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Fix bug where adding an activity from the Suggestions tab doesn't properly update the suggestions list and Pieces tab Practice Statistics. The suggestions should change when a piece is practiced (removing that piece and showing new suggestions), and the Pieces tab should show updated "last practice" dates.

**Bug Analysis:**
- **User Report**: Activities added via Suggestions tab don't update suggestions list or Pieces tab statistics
- **Expected Behavior**: Adding activity should update piece's last practice date and refresh suggestions
- **Current Behavior**: Suggestions remain unchanged, Pieces tab shows outdated "last practice" information

**Technical Analysis:**
- **Activity Addition Flows**: Both normal and suggestions flows call `repository.insertActivity()` correctly
- **Repository Method**: `insertActivity()` properly calls `updatePieceStatistics(pieceId)` for both flows
- **Statistics Update**: `updatePieceStatistics()` correctly calculates and updates piece fields:
  - `lastPracticeDate` = most recent practice timestamp
  - `secondLastPracticeDate` = second most recent practice timestamp  
  - `lastPerformanceDate` = most recent performance timestamp
- **Suggestions Algorithm**: `SuggestionsService` relies on piece statistics fields (`piece.lastPracticeDate`, `piece.lastPerformanceDate`) for determining suggestions
- **Pieces Tab Display**: `PiecesViewModel` uses piece statistics (`piece.lastPracticeDate`, `piece.lastPerformanceDate`) for "Last:" display

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Architecture**: Both flows call same `repository.insertActivity()` method which calls `updatePieceStatistics()`
- **Key Difference**: Coroutine scope and lifecycle issue
- **Dashboard Flow**: Uses `viewModelScope.launch` in `AddActivityViewModel` - not tied to UI lifecycle
- **Suggestions Flow**: Used `lifecycleScope.launch` in dialog → `suspend fun addActivity()` - tied to dialog lifecycle
- **Root Cause**: Dialog lifecycle cancelling coroutine before database operations complete
  - `QuickAddActivityDialogFragment` calls `viewModel.addActivity()` in `lifecycleScope.launch`
  - Dialog dismissal cancels the `lifecycleScope`, which cancels the running coroutine
  - `repository.insertActivity()` gets interrupted before `updatePieceStatistics()` can run
  - **Log Evidence**: "Job was cancelled" error in QuickAddActivityViewModel

**Solution Implemented:**
- **GlobalScope Coroutine**: Changed `QuickAddActivityViewModel.addActivity()` to use `GlobalScope.launch` instead of `viewModelScope.launch`
- **Root Cause**: Dialog lifecycle was cancelling `viewModelScope` when dialog dismissed, preventing database operations from completing
- **Fix**: `GlobalScope` isn't tied to dialog lifecycle, allowing database operations to complete even after dialog dismisses

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Analyze complete activity addition flows for both suggestions and normal paths
- [x] Identify specific cause of statistics update failure (dialog dismissal timing)
- [x] Implement fix to ensure piece statistics update before dialog dismissal
- [x] Verify suggestions refresh properly after adding activity from suggestions tab
- [x] Verify Pieces tab shows updated "last practice" dates immediately  
- [x] Test that database transaction completes before UI updates
- [x] Test both scenarios (suggestions tab and normal activity addition) work identically

### Phase 6: Fix Lifetime Activities Count Bug on Activity Deletion
**Status:** 🎫 Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-30  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Fix bug where deleting an activity in the calendar correctly decreases the Stored Activities count but fails to decrease the Lifetime Activities count. The Lifetime Activities count should represent the cumulative total of activities ever created, so it should decrease when activities are permanently deleted.

**Bug Analysis:**
- **User Report**: Deleting activities reduces Stored Activities count but not Lifetime Activities count
- **Expected Behavior**: Both Stored Activities and Lifetime Activities counts should decrease when activity is deleted
- **Current Behavior**: Only Stored Activities count decreases, Lifetime Activities count remains unchanged
- **Impact**: Lifetime Activities count becomes inaccurate over time as deletions accumulate

**Technical Analysis:**
- **Activity Deletion Flow**: Activities deleted through calendar interface → repository deletion methods
- **Counter Management**: `ConfigurationManager` handles both stored and lifetime activity counts
- **Stored Activities**: Calculated dynamically from database (decreases correctly on deletion)
- **Lifetime Activities**: Maintained as persistent counter (may not be decremented on deletion)

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Activity Addition Flow**: `PianoRepository.insertActivity()` calls `configurationManager.incrementLifetimeActivityCount(1)` on line 105
- **Activity Deletion Flow**: `PianoRepository.deleteActivity()` does **NOT** call any lifetime counter decrement method
- **Missing Method**: `ConfigurationManager` has `incrementLifetimeActivityCount()` but **no `decrementLifetimeActivityCount()` method exists**
- **Deletion Interfaces**: Both `CalendarViewModel.deleteActivity()` and `TimelineViewModel.deleteActivity()` call `repository.deleteActivity()`

**Code Analysis:**
```kotlin
// ✅ INSERTION (increments lifetime counter)
suspend fun insertActivity(activity: Activity) {
    activityDao.insert(activity)
    configurationManager.incrementLifetimeActivityCount(1)  // ✅ Increments
    updatePieceStatistics(activity.pieceOrTechniqueId)
}

// ❌ USER DELETION (missing lifetime counter decrement) 
suspend fun deleteActivity(activity: Activity) {
    val pieceId = activity.pieceOrTechniqueId
    activityDao.delete(activity)                           // ✅ Removes from DB
    updatePieceStatistics(pieceId)                         // ✅ Updates piece stats
    // ❌ MISSING: configurationManager.decrementLifetimeActivityCount(1)
}

// ✅ DATA PRUNING (correctly preserves lifetime count)
suspend fun deleteActivitiesWithoutStatsUpdate(activityIds: List<Long>): Int {
    return activityDao.deleteActivitiesByIds(activityIds)  // ✅ Only removes from DB
    // ✅ CORRECT: No lifetime counter change (pruning != user deletion)
}
```

**ConfigurationManager Gap:**
- Has: `incrementLifetimeActivityCount(increment: Int = 1)`
- Missing: `decrementLifetimeActivityCount(decrement: Int = 1)`

**Impact:**
- Stored Activities count = `activityDao.getActivityCount()` (correct, reflects database)
- Lifetime Activities count = persistent counter (incorrect, only increments, never decrements)

**Critical Distinction - Two Types of Deletion:**
1. **User Deletion** (Calendar/Timeline): Should decrement lifetime counter (user consciously removing activities)
2. **Data Pruning**: Should NOT change lifetime counter (automatic cleanup, activities were genuinely created)

**Current Behavior Analysis:**
- ✅ **Data Pruning**: Uses `deleteActivitiesWithoutStatsUpdate()` - correctly preserves lifetime count
- ❌ **User Deletion**: Uses `deleteActivity()` - incorrectly fails to decrement lifetime count
- **Result**: Both stored count decreases, but only user deletions should affect lifetime count

**Solution Requirements:**
1. **Add Missing Method**: Create `decrementLifetimeActivityCount(decrement: Int = 1)` in `ConfigurationManager`
2. **Update Repository**: Modify `PianoRepository.deleteActivity()` to call the decrement method  
3. **Preserve Pruning**: Ensure `deleteActivitiesWithoutStatsUpdate()` remains unchanged (correctly preserves lifetime count)
4. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure symmetry between insertion and deletion flows for user actions only

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Research activity deletion flow in calendar interface
- [x] Identify where lifetime counter should be decremented during deletion  
- [x] Analyze root cause and document missing decrement functionality
- [ ] Implement `decrementLifetimeActivityCount()` method in `ConfigurationManager`
- [ ] Update `PianoRepository.deleteActivity()` to decrement lifetime counter
- [ ] Verify both Stored and Lifetime Activities counts decrease correctly on USER deletion
- [ ] Verify Lifetime Activities count is PRESERVED during data pruning
- [ ] Test deletion from different interfaces (calendar, timeline, etc.)
- [ ] Test data pruning does not affect lifetime counter
- [ ] Ensure counter consistency is maintained across all deletion scenarios
