**Date Added:** 2025-01-28  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Ensure that changes made in DevCycle 2025-0007 haven't introduced any regressions in existing functionality.
**Build Version:** 1.0.8.22-beta
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Test all features that were not modified still work correctly
- [ ] Verify no new crashes or stability issues have been introduced

## Cycle Notes

- This cycle validates build 1.0.8.22-beta which contains all DevCycle 2025-0007 implementations
- Focus on comprehensive testing rather than new feature development
- All testing should be documented with detailed steps and results
- Any issues discovered should be prioritized and tracked for resolution
- Success criteria: build 1.0.8.22-beta passes all testing phases without critical issues

## Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing Approach
- Test each feature systematically with documented steps
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Verify user experience flows work intuitively
- Document any unexpected behavior or performance issues
- Compare behavior with previous builds when relevant

### Priority Testing Areas
1. **Critical**: Core functionality and DevCycle 2025-0007 features
2. **High**: Suggestions algorithm consolidation and performance optimizations
3. **Medium**: Edge cases and stress testing
4. **Low**: Minor UI polish and non-functional testing

### Issue Reporting Format
For each issue discovered, document:
- **Issue Title:** Brief description of the problem
- **Phase:** Which testing phase discovered the issue
- **Steps to Reproduce:** Detailed steps to recreate the issue
- **Expected Behavior:** What should happen
- **Actual Behavior:** What actually happens
- **Build Version:** 1.0.8.22-beta
- **Device/OS:** Device model and Android version
- **Severity:** Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **Screenshots:** If applicable

## Future Cycles

After testing completion, the next cycle will focus on:
- Issue resolution if any critical problems are found
- Production release preparation (DevCycle 2025-0009)
- Post-launch monitoring and iteration planning
