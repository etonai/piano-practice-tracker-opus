# Development Cycle 2025-0014

**Status:** Open  
**Start Date:** 2025-08-11  
**Focus:** Testing Build 1.0.8.29-beta

## Overview

This development cycle focuses on comprehensive testing of build 1.0.8.29-beta, which incorporates all the enhancements and fixes completed in DevCycle 2025-0013. The cycle validates the complete system including the practice suggestions improvements, streak milestone analytics deduplication, and removal of unauthorized milestones, ensuring readiness for production release preparation.

## Current Work Items

### Phase 1: Test Build 1.0.8.29-beta with Enhanced Features
**Status:** ðŸŽ« Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-11  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** Conduct comprehensive testing of build 1.0.8.29-beta to validate all enhancements from DevCycle 2025-0013 and ensure overall system stability and performance.
**Build Version:** 1.0.8.29-beta

**Testing Focus Areas:**
- Practice suggestions consistency between dashboard and suggestions tab
- Streak milestone analytics deduplication (events sent only once per day)
- Analytics system limited to authorized milestones (3, 5, 8, 14 days only)
- Dashboard practice suggestions with proper favorite/non-favorite limits
- Performance suggestions functionality (with mixed ordering pending strategy decision)
- All existing functionality from previous DevCycles remains stable
- Firebase Analytics validation for all implemented features

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Complete testing of build 1.0.8.29-beta functionality
- [ ] Verify practice suggestions show same counts in dashboard and suggestions tab
- [ ] Confirm dashboard practice suggestions respect Pro/Free user limits properly
- [ ] Test streak milestone analytics deduplication across multiple app sessions
- [ ] Verify only authorized milestones (3, 5, 8, 14) send analytics events
- [ ] Confirm no analytics events for unauthorized milestones (21, 30, 50, 100)
- [ ] Validate Firebase Analytics shows accurate event data without duplicates
- [ ] Test performance suggestions display correctly (mixed ordering as expected)
- [ ] Verify all existing app functionality continues to work correctly
- [ ] Confirm no performance degradation from implemented changes
- [ ] Test application stability across various usage scenarios
- [ ] Validate user experience improvements from DevCycle 2025-0013 changes
- [ ] Document any issues or unexpected behaviors discovered during testing
- [ ] Verify application meets quality standards for production readiness

**Analytics Validation Requirements:**
- [ ] Real-time event verification via Firebase DebugView
- [ ] Confirm streak milestone events appear only once per milestone per day
- [ ] Validate practice suggestions analytics work correctly
- [ ] Test milestone analytics deduplication across app restarts
- [ ] Verify analytics data accuracy and completeness

### Phase 2: Simplify Favorited Practice Suggestions Algorithm
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-11  
**Date Completed:** 2025-08-12  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Simplify the favorited practice suggestions algorithm to use a straightforward 14-hour exclusion period and prioritize least recently practiced pieces. Replace the current complex "2 days AND not today" logic with a simpler, more predictable approach.

**Current Complex Logic:**
- Favorites excluded if: (practiced within 2 days) OR (practiced today)
- Double filtering with `twoDaysAgo` AND `startOfToday` creates confusing behavior
- Additional fallback exclusion logic adds complexity

**Proposed Simplified Algorithm:**
1. **Filter**: Select all favorited pieces NOT practiced OR performed in the last 14 hours
2. **Sort**: Order by least recently practiced/performed piece first (oldest activity first)
3. **Limit**: Apply user limits (1 for Free users, 4 for Pro users)
4. **Return**: Final favorited practice suggestions list

**Technical Changes Needed:**
- Replace complex dual-condition filtering in `SuggestionsService.generatePracticeSuggestions()`
- Create 14-hour threshold calculation (14 * 60 * 60 * 1000 milliseconds)
- Consider both practice AND performance activities for exclusion
- Sort by oldest `lastActivityDate` (practice or performance) first
- Remove fallback "today" exclusion logic for favorites

**Expected Benefits:**
- More predictable and consistent favorite suggestions
- Simpler logic easier to understand and maintain
- Favorites get more opportunities to appear (14 hours vs current ~48 hours)
- Clear prioritization of pieces that haven't been touched recently

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Investigate current favorited practice suggestion filtering logic
- [x] Implement 14-hour exclusion period for favorited pieces
- [x] Consider both practice AND performance activities in exclusion logic
- [x] Sort favorited pieces by least recently practiced/performed first (existing logic maintained)
- [x] Apply correct user limits (1 for Free, 4 for Pro users) (existing logic maintained)
- [x] Remove complex dual-condition filtering logic
- [x] Update fallback logic to use consistent 14-hour exclusion
- [x] Test that favorited pieces practiced/performed 14+ hours ago appear in suggestions
- [x] Verify favorited pieces practiced/performed within 14 hours are excluded
- [x] Confirm no regression in non-favorite suggestion logic
- [x] Validate sorting prioritizes least recently touched favorites

### Phase 3: Improve Practice Suggestion Time Display Precision
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-12  
**Date Completed:** 2025-08-12  
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:** Enhance the user experience of practice suggestions by displaying more precise time information for recently practiced pieces. When a practice suggestion shows a piece that was last practiced or performed less than 2 days ago, display the time in hours instead of days for better granularity.

**Current Behavior:**
- All suggestions show time in days: "Last practice 1 day ago"
- This is imprecise for recent activities (e.g., 25 hours ago shows as "1 day ago")

**Proposed Enhancement:**
- For pieces last practiced/performed < 48 hours ago: display in hours ("Last practice 25 hours ago")
- For pieces last practiced/performed â‰¥ 48 hours ago: continue displaying in days ("Last practice 3 days ago")
- Apply this logic to both practice and performance suggestion reason text

**Technical Implementation:**
- Update `SuggestionsService.generatePracticeSuggestions()` suggestion reason logic
- Update `SuggestionsService.generatePerformanceSuggestions()` suggestion reason logic
- Calculate hours elapsed: `((now - lastActivityDate) / (60 * 60 * 1000)).toInt()`
- Use conditional logic: if < 48 hours, show hours; else show days

**Expected Benefits:**
- More accurate time representation for recent activities
- Better user understanding of when they last practiced pieces
- Improved decision-making for practice session planning
- Enhanced user experience with more precise information

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Update practice suggestion reason text to show hours when < 48 hours elapsed
- [x] Update performance suggestion reason text to show hours when < 48 hours elapsed
- [x] Ensure proper hour/hours pluralization ("1 hour ago" vs "25 hours ago")
- [x] Maintain existing day display for activities â‰¥ 48 hours ago
- [x] Test display accuracy for various time ranges (1 hour, 23 hours, 47 hours, 49 hours)
- [x] Verify no regression in existing suggestion logic or sorting
- [x] Confirm suggestion reason text remains user-friendly and clear

## Cycle Notes
