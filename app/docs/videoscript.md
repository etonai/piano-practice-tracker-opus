# PlayStreak


These tabs are what you'll typically use every day when you are ready for practice.



## Dashboard
Overview of what you need to know
Your streak
What you've done today
What you did yesterday
How your week is looking
And some suggestions of pieces to practice


I just practiced a song, Part of Your World from The Little Mermaid, so I'll enter it now.

And now you see it is included on the list of activities for today. And my streak has increased to 2 days.

That's the gist of the app. Practice a song and add it as an activity. When you aren't practicing, you can look at your practice history.

That's the TLDR of this video, you can just start using it and figure out the rest.

But here's more information about what PlayStreak can do:

## Calendar
At a glance you can see what days you've been active this month
Pick a day and see what you practiced or performed that day

Optionally, you can go into Configuration and enable detail mode...
Which allows you to see more detail about the pieces you practiced an a particular day, and allows you to edit or delete the records.

## Suggestions
The suggestions tab allows you to see what the app is suggesting you practice next, which is based on what you've practiced recently and not so recently
It also allows you to quickly add an activity based on one of those pieces, by selecting the + icon

## Pieces
The pieces tab allows you to see all of the pieces you've entered, and lets you sort by name, last activity date, or by the number of activities for that piece.

When you select a piece, you get additional information on how many times you've practiced it and when was the last
## Settings

The settings is where we keep some additional functionality that you shouldn't need to use every day

### Import/Export Data

Importing and Exporting is the way we handle backing up your data. You can export your data to a JSON file on your device, and you can import it on that device, or transfer the file to another device and import it there.

### Data Pruning Options

Data Pruning, which is disabled by default, allows the user to prune the data when your database gets too large. 

We go into configuration to enable it, and then can see we have buttons to export our data, or prune the oldest 100 activities.
Right now we have a limit of 3000 activities (each activity is either a performance or a practice of a single song or technique), but I'll be doing some performance testing to find out a better higher limit.

When we prune activities, the Lifetime Activities does not change. That is because we want to keep track of our running totals for our pieces.
(Go to Pieces tab).
Even if we prune all of the activities, we'll still be able to look at the Pieces and see the last time the pieces were practiced and how many times we've practiced them

### Configuration

The Configuration allows us to enable and disable some rarely-used functionality.


### Other Notes

What are performances?
I participate in some Discord karaoke servers, so when I perform a piece there, I call it a performance.

What are techniques?
They are like pieces, but are more exercises like doing scales. 

What are those little stars?
Those are favorites. You can designate some pieces as favorites, and they will be easier to select when you are selecting a piece, and PlayStreak will suggest practicing favorites separately from non-favorites


## End

Anyway, let me close this by showing you another way I use this.

I like spending part of my practice time in the suggestions tab. PlayStreak has given me some suggestions, and I'd like to play What I Did For Love. I'll be right back...

Ok, I'm done with practicing it, so I'm adding the activity.

And you can see that PlayStreak has given me another suggestion. I'll play some more of these suggestions, and use the quick add to add them, then I'll go back to my Pieces list to see what I haven't played in a while, or I'll go to the Calendar view and look at the last few days to see what I should continue practicing.

That's it!
