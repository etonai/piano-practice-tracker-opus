# Development Cycle 2025-0018

**Status:** ðŸŽ« Open  
**Start Date:** 2025-09-03  
**Focus:** Production Refinements - Google Play Store Preparation

## Overview

This development cycle focuses on final refinements and optimizations before Google Play Store publication. PlayStreak has been approved by Google and is ready to move to production. This cycle will implement polish, refinements, and final preparations needed before DevCycle 2025-0019 publishes the app to the Google Play Store.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Locate Maximum Activities limit configuration for non-pro users
- Update non-pro user activity limit from 3000 to 3650
- Ensure pro users maintain their current unlimited activities
- Verify activity limit enforcement logic works correctly with new limit
- Test activity storage and deletion behavior at the new limit
- Update any UI messages or documentation referencing the 3000 limit

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Identify code location for Maximum Activities limit enforcement
- [ ] Update non-pro user Maximum Activities limit from 3000 to 3650
- [ ] Verify pro users retain unlimited activity storage
- [ ] Test activity limit enforcement with activities approaching 3650
- [ ] Update any UI text or messages referencing 3000 activity limit
- [ ] Ensure proper behavior when limit is reached (oldest activity deletion)
- [ ] Validate free vs pro user experience differentiation maintained

### Phase 3: Reorder Settings Page Buttons
**Status:** ðŸŽ« Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-09-03  
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:** Reorder the buttons on the Settings page to improve user experience and logical flow, placing most frequently used features at the top and legal documents at the bottom.

**New Button Order:**
1. View Achievements
2. Import/Export Data
3. Configuration
4. Data Pruning Options
5. Privacy Policy
6. Terms of Service

**Technical Requirements:**
- Locate Settings page layout file (likely `fragment_main.xml` or similar)
- Reorder button elements in the layout to match the specified sequence
- Ensure button spacing, styling, and functionality remain unchanged
- Verify all button click listeners and navigation continue to work properly
- Test Settings page layout on different screen sizes
- Maintain existing button text, icons, and styling

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Locate Settings page layout implementation
- [ ] Reorder buttons to specified sequence (1. Achievements, 2. Import/Export, 3. Configuration, 4. Data Pruning, 5. Privacy Policy, 6. Terms of Service)
- [ ] Verify all button functionality remains unchanged after reordering
- [ ] Test Settings page navigation and button interactions
- [ ] Ensure proper button spacing and visual alignment
- [ ] Validate layout works correctly on different screen sizes
- [ ] Confirm no regression in existing Settings functionality

**CRITICAL REMINDER:** Following DevCycles_overview.md rules:
- New phases must be added to documentation first with "ðŸŽ« Open" status
- NEVER immediately implement when adding a new phase
- Wait for explicit approval or further direction before beginning implementation
- Allow time for phase planning, refinement, and clarification

## Cycle Notes

- Google has approved PlayStreak for production release
- DevCycle 2025-0017 successfully completed Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, achievement fixes, and UI improvements
- Current build version: 1.0.8.38-beta (following DevCycle 17 completion)
- This cycle focuses on final refinements before store publication
- DevCycle 2025-0019 will handle the actual Google Play Store publication process

## Future Considerations

Areas that may be addressed in this refinement cycle:
- UI polish and final user experience improvements
- Performance optimizations and code cleanup
- Final testing and quality assurance
- Version number preparation for production release
- App store metadata and asset preparation
- Any remaining minor bugs or improvements
