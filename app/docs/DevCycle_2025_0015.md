# Development Cycle 2025-0015

**Status:** In Progress  
**Start Date:** 2025-08-31  
**Focus:** Testing Build 1.0.8.33-beta

## Overview

This development cycle focuses on comprehensive testing of build 1.0.8.33-beta and addressing any issues discovered during testing. The cycle validates the complete system and ensures readiness for the next phase of development.

## Current Work Items

### Phase 1: Test Build 1.0.8.33-beta
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-31  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** Conduct comprehensive testing of build 1.0.8.33-beta to validate all functionality and ensure overall system stability and performance.
**Build Version:** 1.0.8.33-beta

**Testing Focus Areas:**
- Overall application stability and performance
- Core functionality validation
- User interface and user experience testing
- Feature functionality verification
- Analytics and data tracking validation
- Performance and responsiveness testing
- Cross-functional integration testing

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Complete testing of build 1.0.8.33-beta functionality
- [x] Verify all core features work as expected
- [x] Test application stability across various usage scenarios
- [x] Validate user interface responsiveness and appearance
- [x] Confirm no performance degradation from previous builds
- [x] Test analytics and tracking functionality
- [x] Verify data persistence and retrieval
- [x] Document any issues or unexpected behaviors discovered during testing
- [x] Validate application meets quality standards for continued development
- [x] Test application across different device configurations if applicable

**Analytics Validation Requirements:**
- [x] Real-time event verification via Firebase DebugView if applicable
- [x] Validate analytics data accuracy and completeness
- [x] Test tracking functionality across app sessions
- [x] Verify analytics integration works correctly

### Phase 2: Fix Add Piece Capitalization Bug
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-31  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Fix inconsistent capitalization behavior when adding new pieces through Add Activity vs. Pieces tab. When adding a new piece from Add Activity (via "Add New" button), the piece name input does not automatically capitalize words, unlike the Add Piece screen from the Pieces tab.

**Problem Analysis:**
- **Add Piece screen** (Pieces tab → Add Piece button): Uses `android:inputType="textCapWords"` - automatically capitalizes first letter of each word
- **Add New piece screen** (Add Activity → Add New button): Uses `android:inputType="text"` - no automatic capitalization
- This creates inconsistent user experience and potential inconsistent piece naming

**Root Cause:**
- `fragment_add_piece.xml` line 36: `android:inputType="textCapWords"` ✅ (correct)
- `fragment_add_new_piece.xml` line 30: `android:inputType="text"` ❌ (missing capitalization)

**Proposed Solution:**
Change the Add New piece screen's EditText input type from `"text"` to `"textCapWords"` to match the behavior of the Add Piece screen.

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_add_new_piece.xml` - Update inputType on editTextName field

**Technical Implementation:**
- Update line 30 in `fragment_add_new_piece.xml`
- Change `android:inputType="text"` to `android:inputType="textCapWords"`
- No backend logic changes needed (capitalization happens at UI input level)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Investigate and understand the capitalization bug details
- [x] Identify root cause of the capitalization issue (inputType mismatch)
- [x] Identify specific files and lines to modify
- [x] Implement appropriate fix for the bug (change inputType)
- [x] Test the fix to ensure Add New piece screen capitalizes like Add Piece screen
- [x] Verify both screens now have consistent capitalization behavior
- [x] Verify no regression in existing functionality
- [x] Test that piece names are properly formatted in both entry methods
- [x] Document the fix and code changes made

**Implementation Summary:**
- **File Modified:** `app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_add_new_piece.xml`
- **Change Made:** Line 30 - Changed `android:inputType="text"` to `android:inputType="textCapWords"`
- **Result:** Add New piece screen now matches Add Piece screen capitalization behavior

## Cycle Notes
