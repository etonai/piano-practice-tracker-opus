- [ ] Verify all DevCycle 2025-0008 fixes continue to work correctly
- [ ] Test application stability and performance with all new features
- [ ] Document any issues or bugs discovered during testing
- [ ] Verify application meets quality standards for production release

### Phase 2: Enhance Dashboard Week Summary with Bullet Points
**Status:** ðŸŽ« Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-04  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Modify the Week Summary section on the Dashboard to display information using bullet points instead of the current text format. This enhancement will improve readability and make the weekly activity summary more scannable for users.

**Current Implementation:**
The Week Summary currently displays as plain text paragraphs or sentences describing the user's weekly activity patterns and statistics.

**Target Enhancement:**
- Convert Week Summary text content to bullet point format
- Maintain all existing data and functionality
- Improve visual hierarchy and readability
- Ensure consistent styling with the overall Dashboard design
- Preserve responsiveness across different screen sizes

**Technical Considerations:**
- Modify Dashboard fragment/activity layout for Week Summary section
- Update text formatting and styling
- Ensure proper spacing and alignment with bullet points
- Test across different device screen sizes and orientations
- Maintain accessibility standards for screen readers

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Week Summary section displays content in bullet point format
- [ ] All existing Week Summary data is preserved and displayed correctly
- [ ] Bullet points are properly aligned and styled consistently
- [ ] Text remains readable across all supported device sizes
- [ ] No layout breaking or text overflow issues
- [ ] Week Summary maintains its position and sizing within Dashboard
- [ ] Accessibility features continue to work with bullet point format
- [ ] Visual design integrates seamlessly with existing Dashboard elements

### Phase 3: Implement Duplicate Piece Name Validation
**Status:** ðŸŽ« Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-04  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Implement validation to prevent users from creating pieces with duplicate names. This enhancement will improve data integrity and prevent confusion when users have multiple pieces with identical names in their collection.

**Current Implementation:**
The application currently allows users to create multiple pieces with the same name, which can lead to confusion when selecting pieces for practice sessions or viewing statistics.

**Target Enhancement:**
- Add validation logic to prevent duplicate piece names during creation
- Display appropriate error messages when duplicate names are detected
- Apply validation to both "Add New Piece" and "Edit Piece" workflows
- Implement case-insensitive comparison for name uniqueness
- Provide clear user feedback when duplicate names are entered

**Technical Considerations:**
- Modify Add Piece dialog/screen validation logic
- Update Edit Piece dialog/screen validation logic
- Implement database query to check for existing piece names
- Add appropriate error message display mechanisms
- Consider performance impact of name validation queries
- Handle edge cases (trimming whitespace, special characters)
- Ensure validation works across all piece creation entry points

**User Experience Considerations:**
- Display clear, helpful error messages when duplicate names are detected
- Suggest alternative names or allow users to append numbers/suffixes
- Maintain smooth user flow with non-intrusive validation
- Provide immediate feedback (real-time validation vs. on-submit validation)
- Consider showing existing piece names to help users avoid duplicates

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Duplicate piece name validation implemented in "Add New Piece" workflow
- [ ] Duplicate piece name validation implemented in "Edit Piece" workflow
- [ ] Validation performs case-insensitive comparison of piece names
- [ ] Appropriate error messages displayed when duplicate names are detected
- [ ] Validation handles edge cases (whitespace trimming, empty names)
- [ ] Error messages are clear and provide helpful guidance to users
- [ ] Validation does not prevent editing a piece to keep its current name
- [ ] Performance impact of validation queries is minimal
- [ ] Validation works consistently across all piece creation entry points
- [ ] User can easily understand why their input was rejected
- [ ] No negative impact on existing piece management functionality
- [ ] Database integrity maintained with proper constraint handling
