### Phase 2: Enhance Dashboard Week Summary with Specific Metrics and Bullet Points
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-04  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Modify the Week Summary section on the Dashboard to display specific activity metrics from the last 7 days in bullet point format. This enhancement will provide clear, scannable metrics and improve readability of weekly activity data.

**Current Implementation:**
The Week Summary currently displays general text describing weekly activity patterns without specific metrics or clear formatting.

**Target Enhancement:**
- Change section title to "Week Summary - Last 7 days"
- Display activities from the last 7 days (rolling 7-day period)
- Show specific metrics in bullet point format:
  â€¢ Number of practice activities
  â€¢ Number of performance activities  
  â€¢ Total tracked time
- Remove generic "This week" references
- Use bullet points for clear, scannable presentation
- Maintain consistent styling with overall Dashboard design

**Technical Considerations:**
- Modify Dashboard fragment/activity layout for Week Summary section
- Update section title to "Week Summary - Last 7 days"
- Implement rolling 7-day date calculation logic
- Create database queries to count practice activities in last 7 days
- Create database queries to count performance activities in last 7 days
- Calculate total tracked time across all activities in last 7 days
- Format data display with bullet points (â€¢ symbol)
- Ensure proper spacing and alignment with bullet points
- Handle edge cases (no activities, zero time, etc.)
- Test across different device screen sizes and orientations
- Maintain accessibility standards for screen readers

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Section title displays as "Week Summary - Last 7 days"
- [x] Data shows activities from rolling 7-day period (not calendar week)
- [x] Number of practice activities in last 7 days displayed as bullet point
- [x] Number of performance activities in last 7 days displayed as bullet point
- [x] Total tracked time in last 7 days displayed as bullet point
- [x] All three metrics use bullet point formatting (â€¢ symbol)
- [x] No "This week" references remain in the section
- [x] Bullet points are properly aligned and styled consistently
- [x] Data accuracy: counts match actual activities in database for last 7 days
- [x] Time formatting is user-friendly (hours:minutes or appropriate format)
- [x] Edge cases handled gracefully (0 activities, 0 time, etc.)
- [x] Text remains readable across all supported device sizes
- [x] No layout breaking or text overflow issues
- [x] Week Summary maintains its position and sizing within Dashboard
- [x] Accessibility features work correctly with new format
- [x] Visual design integrates seamlessly with existing Dashboard elements

### Phase 3: Implement Duplicate Piece Name Validation
**Status:** ðŸŽ« Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-08-04  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Implement validation to prevent users from creating pieces with duplicate names. When adding a new piece (whether from the Add Piece button or when adding a new piece during activity creation), if the piece name already exists, inform the user that the piece already exists and prevent the duplicate from being created.

**Current Implementation:**
The application currently allows users to create multiple pieces with the same name, which can lead to confusion when selecting pieces for practice sessions or viewing statistics.

**Target Enhancement:**
- Add validation logic to prevent duplicate piece names during creation
- Display clear message: "This piece already exists" when duplicate names are detected
- Apply validation to both entry points:
  â€¢ "Add Piece" button workflow
  â€¢ "Add new piece" during activity creation workflow
- Implement case-insensitive comparison for name uniqueness
- Prevent duplicate piece creation and keep user in the current dialog/screen
- Provide clear, immediate feedback when duplicate names are entered

**Technical Considerations:**
- Modify Add Piece dialog/screen validation logic
- Update Edit Piece dialog/screen validation logic
- Implement database query to check for existing piece names
- Add appropriate error message display mechanisms
- Consider performance impact of name validation queries
- Handle edge cases (trimming whitespace, special characters)
- Ensure validation works across all piece creation entry points

**User Experience Considerations:**
- Display exact message: "This piece already exists" when duplicate names are detected
- Show validation message immediately when duplicate is detected
- Keep user in the current dialog/screen (do not dismiss or navigate away)
- Allow user to modify the piece name and try again
- Maintain smooth user flow with clear, non-intrusive validation
- Apply consistent messaging across both entry points (Add Piece button and activity creation)
- Ensure message is prominent but not disruptive to the overall user experience

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Duplicate piece name validation implemented in "Add Piece" button workflow
- [ ] Duplicate piece name validation implemented in "Add new piece during activity creation" workflow
- [ ] Validation performs case-insensitive comparison of piece names
- [ ] Exact message "This piece already exists" displayed when duplicate names are detected
- [ ] Validation message appears immediately when duplicate is detected
- [ ] User remains in current dialog/screen when duplicate is detected (no dismissal)
- [ ] User can modify piece name and retry after seeing validation message
- [ ] Validation handles edge cases (whitespace trimming, empty names)
- [ ] Validation does not prevent editing a piece to keep its current name
- [ ] Performance impact of validation queries is minimal
- [ ] Consistent messaging across both entry points (Add Piece button and activity creation)
- [ ] Validation message is prominent but not disruptive to user experience
- [ ] No negative impact on existing piece management functionality
- [ ] Database integrity maintained with proper constraint handling
