ðŸŽµ Calling Ukulele Players! Join the PlayStreak Beta - Track Your Practice & Keep Songs in Your Fingers

### Post Content

Hey r/ukulele! ðŸ‘‹

I'm developing **PlayStreak**, an Android app designed to help musicians track their practice sessions and keep their repertoire fresh. I'm looking for ukulele players to join our closed beta test!

**A bit about me:** I've been playing ukulele and piano for years, mostly focusing on songs I can sing along to. Like many of you, I started accumulating more and more songs in my repertoire, but I kept forgetting about older favorites. So I started keeping a spreadsheet to track what I practiced... but honestly, I wasn't happy with the spreadsheet approach. It felt clunky and didn't really help me stay on top of my growing song collection. That frustration led me to develop PlayStreak - an app that actually makes it easy and enjoyable to maintain your musical repertoire.

**Are you someone who:**
- Loves playing lots of different songs on your uke?
- Sometimes forgets about songs you used to play regularly?
- Wants to keep track of which songs you've been practicing?
- Would like reminders to revisit old favorites to keep them "in your fingers"?

**PlayStreak helps you:**
- Log your practice sessions with specific songs
- Track when you last played each piece
- Get suggestions for songs to revisit based on your practice history

The app is designed for ukulele players who have a growing songbook and want to make sure they're regularly cycling through their favorites instead of just playing the same few songs over and over.

**What I'm looking for:**
- Ukulele players who practice regularly (any skill level!)
- Android users willing to test the app and provide feedback
- People who enjoy playing a variety of songs and want to keep them all fresh

If you're interested in helping me test PlayStreak and think it could be useful for your ukulele practice, **please send me a message!** I'd love to have you as part of the beta testing community.

Thanks for reading, and keep strumming! ðŸŽµ

ðŸŽ¹ Piano Players Wanted! Beta Test PlayStreak - Track Your Repertoire & Never Lose Touch with Your Pieces

### Post Content

Hello r/piano! ðŸŽ¹

I'm the developer of **PlayStreak**, an Android app specifically designed to help pianists track their practice and maintain their repertoire. I'm seeking dedicated piano players to join our closed beta testing program!

**My story:** I've been playing piano and ukulele for years, mainly focusing on pieces I can sing along with. As my repertoire grew, I found myself constantly forgetting about songs I used to love playing. I tried keeping a spreadsheet to track my practice sessions, but it quickly became a chore rather than a helpful tool. The spreadsheet felt cumbersome and didn't really solve the core problem of helping me remember to revisit pieces before they got rusty. That's what drove me to create PlayStreak - a purpose-built app that makes repertoire management actually enjoyable and effective.

**To be clear about my approach:** I'm no longer the type of player who spends a month intensively learning a single classical piece, practicing it almost daily and working through different sections. PlayStreak isn't really designed for that kind of deep, section-by-section practice tracking over extended periods. Instead, it's built for players like me who have a collection of shorter pieces or songs that we want to keep fresh and rotate through regularly. If that sounds more like your style of playing, this app might be perfect for you!

**Does this sound like you?**
- You've built up a collection of pieces over the years (classical, jazz, pop, whatever you love!)
- You sometimes realize it's been months since you played a piece you used to know well
- You want to keep all your learned pieces "under your fingers" instead of letting them get rusty
- You'd love a systematic way to track your practice and rotate through your repertoire

**PlayStreak is built for pianists who:**
- Have multiple pieces in various stages of mastery
- Want to maintain technical proficiency across their entire repertoire
- Enjoy tracking their musical progress and practice consistency
- Need gentle reminders to revisit pieces before they start to fade

The app helps you log practice sessions, track when you last worked on each piece, and get suggestions for which pieces need attention. PlayStreak helps ensure nothing gets forgotten.

**I'm looking for beta testers who:**
- Play piano regularly (any level from intermediate to advanced!)
- Use Android devices
- Have a repertoire of multiple pieces they want to maintain
- Are willing to provide feedback during the testing phase

If this resonates with you and you'd like to help shape an app made by musicians, for musicians, **please send me a message!** I'd be thrilled to have your input as we refine PlayStreak.

Thanks for your time, and happy practicing! ðŸŽ¼

## Post 3 - Personal Post

Hi, I'm a singing uke/piano player, and built an app to help me track my practice habits (converted from a spreadsheet). I'm looking for some beta testers to help me work out the kinks. It's free.

Here's how I use it:
- I practice a song
- I add it to the app, along with rating how well I think I did
- I go do another song

Calendar:
- Keeps track of streaks, allows me to see what I've practiced on a day 

- Keeps track of what songs I've played the most, and when

- Allows you to export that data (backup feature)
- If you have too many practice sessions, it allows you to delete old records, but still keeping track of how many times you've played a piece and the last few times

Suggestions:
- After the app collects enough data, it starts giving suggestions on what to play, based on what you haven't played in a while

In the last 4 months, I've played 38 different songs anywhere from 1 time to 49 times.


If you have an android device and are interested in joining the beta, send me a message and I'll get you a link.
If you have an iOS device and are interested in this app, let me know and I'll send you a message when I port it to the iPhone!

I'm also recruiting testers from other instrument communities - all musicians are welcome!

## Post 4 - ChatGPT revised my Post 3

Looking for Beta Testers â€“ Music Practice Tracking App (Android)

Hi everyone! I'm a singing uke/piano player who built a simple Android app to help track my practice habits â€” I originally started with a spreadsheet, but this app has made things much easier.

Now I'm looking for a few beta testers to help try it out and iron out any issues. Itâ€™s completely free.

What the app does:

After I practice a song, I log it in the app and rate how well I did.

I move on to the next song, log that too â€” easy and quick.

Key features:

Calendar View: See your practice streaks and what you practiced each day.

History Tracking: View how often you've practiced each song and when you last played it.

Suggestions: Once enough data is collected, the app starts suggesting songs you havenâ€™t practiced in a while.

Export & Backup: You can export your data to a CSV file for backup.

Storage Management: If you practice a lot, you can clear older logs while keeping core stats (like total plays and recent sessions).

For example, over the past 4 months, Iâ€™ve practiced 38 different songs â€” some just once, others nearly 50 times. This app helps me keep it all straight.

Interested?

If you have an Android device, send me a message and Iâ€™ll send you the beta link.

If you're on iOS, Iâ€™m planning to port it â€” let me know if youâ€™d like an update when thatâ€™s ready.

I'm also reaching out to other instrument communities â€” this app works for any musician, not just uke/piano players!

Thanks, and happy practicing!

TL;DR: Free music practice tracking app needs beta testers. Android available now, iOS coming soon.

Hey musicians! I'm a singing piano/uke player who got tired of managing practice sessions in spreadsheets, so I built an app to solve the problem. After testing with 4 months of personal data (tracked 39 songs, some played up to 50 times), I'm ready to share it with fellow musicians.

Quick demo:  https://youtube.com/shorts/_nynODrn4m4

What it does:

Simple logging: Add songs after practice with a personal rating
Helpful insights: Track streaks, see your most/least practiced songs, and view practice history
Data export: Full backup functionality so your data stays yours
Suggestions: Once you have enough data, the app suggests what to practice based on songs you haven't touched in a while
Clean management: Archive old sessions while preserving play counts and recent history

Perfect for musicians who want to:

Build consistent practice habits
Track improvement over time
Never forget that song they learned months ago
Get gentle nudges about neglected pieces

Join the beta:

Android users: DM me for the beta link
