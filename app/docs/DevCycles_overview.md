# Development Cycles Overview

This document explains the development cycle process used for organizing and tracking focused work periods in the PlayStreak project.

## Purpose

Development cycles provide a structured approach to:
- Focus on completing specific features or improvements
- Track progress with clear TODO items and phase breakdowns
- Document implementation details and decisions
- Ensure thorough testing and verification before completion
- Maintain historical record of development work

## Cycle Structure

### Naming Convention
Development cycles follow the format: `DevCycle_YYYY_####.md`
- **YYYY**: Year (e.g., 2025)
- **####**: Sequential 4-digit cycle number (e.g., 0001, 0002, 0003)

**Examples:**
- `DevCycle_2025_0001.md` - First development cycle of 2025
- `DevCycle_2025_0002.md` - Second development cycle of 2025

### File Organization
- **Active cycles**: Stored in `/docs/` directory during development
- **Completed cycles**: Moved to `/docs/devcycles/` directory for archival
- **Current cycle**: Always the active cycle document in `/docs/`

### Document Template Structure

Each development cycle document should include:

```markdown
# Development Cycle YYYY-####

**Status:** [In Progress/Completed/On Hold]  
**Start Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Target Completion:** YYYY-MM-DD or TBD  
**Focus:** [Brief description of cycle focus]

## Overview
[2-3 sentences describing the cycle's purpose and goals]

## Current Work Items
[List of features, bugs, or tickets being addressed]

### [Feature/Bug/Ticket Name]
**Status:** [Emoji and status]  
**Priority:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low]  
**Description:** [Brief description]

#### Phase Progress
**Phase [Name]:**
- ✅ [Completed item]
- ❌ TODO: [Pending item]

#### Technical Implementation Details
[Code changes, dependencies, configurations, etc.]

#### Next Steps
[Immediate next actions]

## Cycle Notes
[Important observations, decisions, or context]

## Future Cycles
[What might be addressed in subsequent cycles]

## Cycle Completion Summary
*[Added when cycle is completed]*

**Final Build Version:** [e.g., 1.0.8.15-beta]  
**Completion Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Git Commit Status:** [All changes committed / Commit hash if applicable]

**Accomplishments:**
- [Major feature/bug/ticket completed]
- [Key technical improvements made]
- [Important milestones reached]

**Metrics:**
- [Files modified count]
- [Features implemented]
- [Bugs fixed]
- [Tests added/updated]

**Notes:**
- [Key learnings or insights]
- [Challenges encountered and solutions]
- [Impact on app functionality or performance]
- [Version control status and commit details]
```

## Cycle Management Process

### 1. Cycle Initiation
- Create new DevCycle document when starting focused work
- Define clear scope and objectives
- Identify primary work items (features, bugs, tickets)
- Set realistic target completion dates

### 2. Active Development
- Update TODO items in real-time as work progresses
- Mark completed items with ✅
- Mark pending items with ❌ TODO:
- Document technical decisions and implementation details
- Add cycle notes for important context or changes

### 3. Progress Tracking
- Regularly review and update cycle status
- Adjust scope if needed (document changes in cycle notes)
- Ensure all work aligns with cycle objectives
- Maintain clear next steps for continuation

### 4. Cycle Completion
- Verify all work items are complete or properly transitioned
- **Ensure all code changes are committed to version control**
- **Confirm completion date and time with user before marking cycle complete**
- Update final status to "Completed"
- Document cycle accomplishments summary
- Record final build version number for the cycle
- Document lessons learned in cycle notes
- Move completed cycle document to `devcycles/` directory for archival
- Plan subsequent cycle if needed

### 5. Cycle Handoff
- When switching between developers or sessions
- Current cycle status provides clear continuation point
- All context and progress preserved in documentation
- New work can start immediately from documented state

## Integration with Existing Documentation

### Relationship to Other Documents
- **features.md**: Individual features referenced in cycles maintain their own status
- **bugs.md**: Bug fixes implemented during cycles update bug status
- **tickets.md**: Tickets addressed in cycles update ticket status
- **CLAUDE.md**: Verification rules apply to all cycle work items

### Status Synchronization
- Work items in cycles must maintain consistent status with source documents
- Completed cycle work triggers status updates in features.md, bugs.md, or tickets.md
- Verification requirements apply: items move to verification status until user confirms

### Documentation Flow
1. Work identified in features.md, bugs.md, or tickets.md
2. Work planned and tracked in DevCycle document
3. Implementation progresses with TODO tracking
4. Completion updates both cycle and source document status
5. User verification required before final completion marking

## Benefits

### For Developers
- Clear focus and scope for work sessions
- Detailed progress tracking prevents lost work
- Historical context for implementation decisions
- Easy handoff between sessions or team members

### For Project Management
- Visibility into current development focus
- Progress tracking across multiple work items
- Historical record of development cycles
- Clear completion criteria and verification requirements

### For Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive documentation of changes
- Clear testing requirements and verification steps
- Implementation details support thorough testing
- Progress tracking ensures nothing is missed

## Best Practices

### Scope Management
- Keep cycles focused (typically 1-3 major work items)
- Break large features into multiple cycles if needed
- Document scope changes and rationale
- Don't let cycles grow beyond manageable size

### Documentation Quality
- Update TODO items frequently during development
- Include relevant technical details and code snippets
- Document decisions and their rationale
- Maintain clear next steps for continuity
- Record build version numbers at key milestones

### Progress Tracking
- Be honest about completion status
- Mark items complete only when fully implemented
- Follow verification requirements before final completion
- Update source documents consistently
- **Confirm completion timing with user before finalizing cycle status**

### Cycle Transitions
- Complete current cycle documentation before starting new cycle
- **Ensure all code changes are committed before marking cycle complete**
- **Confirm completion date/time with user before finalizing cycle**
- Move completed cycle to `devcycles/` directory for archival
- Ensure clear handoff documentation
- Plan subsequent cycles based on previous cycle outcomes
- Maintain continuity in development focus

### Archival Process
- Create `/docs/devcycles/` directory if it doesn't exist
- Move completed `DevCycle_YYYY_####.md` file to `/docs/devcycles/`
- Completed cycles serve as historical record and reference
- Archival keeps active `/docs/` directory focused on current work
