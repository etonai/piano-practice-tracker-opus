### Phase 2: Fix Lifetime Activities Count Bug on Piece Deletion
**Status:** üé´ Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-30  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Fix bug where deleting a piece with associated activities correctly decreases the Stored Activities count but fails to decrease the Lifetime Activities count. When a piece is deleted, all its associated activities are also deleted, so the Lifetime Activities count should decrease by the number of deleted activities.

**Bug Analysis:**
- **User Report**: Deleting piece with activities reduces Stored Activities count but not Lifetime Activities count
- **Expected Behavior**: Both Stored Activities and Lifetime Activities counts should decrease by number of deleted activities
- **Current Behavior**: Only Stored Activities count decreases, Lifetime Activities count remains unchanged
- **Relationship to DevCycle 2025-0008 Phase 6**: Phase 6 fixed individual activity deletion, but piece deletion may use different code path

**Technical Context:**
- This appears related to DevCycle 2025-0008 Phase 6 which fixed lifetime counter for individual activity deletion
- Phase 6 added `decrementLifetimeActivityCount()` to `PianoRepository.deleteActivity()`
- Piece deletion likely uses `PianoRepository.deletePieceAndActivities()` which may not call the lifetime counter decrement
- The piece deletion flow deletes multiple activities at once and may bypass the individual activity deletion logic

**Root Cause Analysis:**

**Code Flow Analysis:**

**1. Piece Deletion Entry Point:**
- `PiecesViewModel.deletePiece()` calls `repository.deletePieceAndActivities(pieceId)` (PiecesViewModel.kt:167)

**2. Repository Implementation Analysis:**
```kotlin
// PianoRepository.kt lines 54-60
suspend fun deletePieceAndActivities(pieceId: Long) {
    // First delete all activities for this piece
    activityDao.deleteActivitiesForPiece(pieceId)        // ‚ùå BULK DELETE - NO LIFETIME COUNTER
    // Then delete the piece itself
    val piece = pieceOrTechniqueDao.getById(pieceId)
    piece?.let { pieceOrTechniqueDao.delete(it) }
}
```

**3. DAO Implementation Analysis:**
```kotlin  
// ActivityDao.kt line 40-41
@Query("DELETE FROM activities WHERE pieceOrTechniqueId = :pieceId")
suspend fun deleteActivitiesForPiece(pieceId: Long)     // ‚ùå BULK SQL DELETE - BYPASSES LIFETIME COUNTER
```

**4. Comparison with Individual Activity Deletion (Fixed in Phase 6):**
```kotlin
// PianoRepository.kt lines 115-123 (FIXED in DevCycle 2025-0008 Phase 6)
suspend fun deleteActivity(activity: Activity) {
    val pieceId = activity.pieceOrTechniqueId
    activityDao.delete(activity)                          // ‚úÖ Single delete
    configurationManager.decrementLifetimeActivityCount(1) // ‚úÖ DECREMENTS LIFETIME COUNTER
    updatePieceStatistics(pieceId)
}
```

**Critical Difference Identified:**

**Individual Activity Deletion (‚úÖ WORKS):**
- Uses `repository.deleteActivity()` 
- Calls `configurationManager.decrementLifetimeActivityCount(1)` for each activity
- Properly decrements lifetime counter

**Piece Deletion (‚ùå BROKEN):**
- Uses `repository.deletePieceAndActivities()` 
- Calls `activityDao.deleteActivitiesForPiece()` - **BULK SQL DELETE**
- **NEVER calls lifetime counter decrement**
- Activities are deleted from database but lifetime counter remains unchanged

**Root Cause:**
The piece deletion flow uses a **bulk SQL DELETE operation** that bypasses the individual activity deletion logic entirely. Unlike individual activity deletion which calls `deleteActivity()` (and thus decrements the lifetime counter), piece deletion directly calls the DAO's bulk delete method.

**Technical Analysis:**
- **Bulk Delete**: `deleteActivitiesForPiece()` executes raw SQL: `DELETE FROM activities WHERE pieceOrTechniqueId = :pieceId`
- **No Iteration**: Does not loop through activities to call individual deletion logic  
- **No Counter Update**: Never calls `configurationManager.decrementLifetimeActivityCount()`
- **Direct Database**: Removes records directly from Room database without triggering application-level deletion logic

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Stored Activities**: ‚úÖ Correctly decreases (database reflects actual deletion)
- **Lifetime Activities**: ‚ùå Remains unchanged (persistent counter not updated)
- **Severity**: High - creates permanent data inconsistency that accumulates over time

**Relationship to DevCycle 2025-0008 Phase 6:**
- **Same Root Problem**: Missing lifetime counter decrements on deletion
- **Different Code Path**: Phase 6 fixed individual deletions, but piece deletion uses separate bulk deletion path
- **Architectural Gap**: Bulk operations don't integrate with application-level counter management

**Solution Requirements:**
The piece deletion method needs to either:
1. **Get activity count BEFORE deletion** and decrement lifetime counter by that amount, OR  
2. **Iterate through activities** and call `deleteActivity()` for each one (slower but consistent)

**Files Involved:**
- `PianoRepository.kt`: `deletePieceAndActivities()` method (lines 54-60)
- `ActivityDao.kt`: `deleteActivitiesForPiece()` method (line 40-41)
- `PiecesViewModel.kt`: `deletePiece()` method (line 167)
- `ConfigurationManager.kt`: `decrementLifetimeActivityCount()` method (available from Phase 6 fix)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Research piece deletion flow in codebase
- [x] Compare piece deletion vs individual activity deletion implementations  
- [x] Identify why lifetime counter is not decremented during piece deletion
- [x] Document root cause and relationship to DevCycle 2025-0008 Phase 6
- [ ] Implement fix to ensure lifetime counter decreases when piece with activities is deleted
- [ ] Verify both Stored and Lifetime Activities counts decrease correctly on piece deletion
- [ ] Test that piece deletion without activities doesn't affect lifetime counter
- [ ] Ensure fix doesn't break existing individual activity deletion functionality

### Phase 3: Fix Piece Title Text Clipping in Detail View
**Status:** üé´ Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-30  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Fix UI issue where long piece titles in the piece detail view are vertically cut off on the last line. When viewing piece details from the Pieces tab, titles that span multiple lines have their bottom portion clipped, making the text partially unreadable.

**Bug Analysis:**
- **User Report**: Long piece titles are vertically cut off in piece detail view
- **Expected Behavior**: Full piece title should be visible with proper text layout and spacing
- **Current Behavior**: Last line of multi-line titles is partially clipped/cut off vertically
- **Scope**: Affects piece detail view accessed from Pieces tab
- **Impact**: Reduces readability and user experience when viewing pieces with longer titles

**Technical Context:**
- Issue occurs in piece detail view/dialog when titles exceed single line width
- Likely related to TextView height constraints, padding, or layout parameters
- May involve insufficient vertical space allocation for multi-line text
- Could be caused by fixed height constraints or improper line spacing calculations

**Investigation Required:**
- Identify the piece detail view layout file and TextView implementation
- Analyze TextView height constraints and layout parameters for piece titles
- Check if issue is caused by fixed height, insufficient padding, or line height problems
- Examine how multi-line text is handled in the piece detail view
- Test with various title lengths to understand clipping behavior
- Compare with other text views in the app that handle multi-line text correctly

**Potential Root Causes:**
- TextView has fixed height that doesn't accommodate multiple lines
- Insufficient bottom padding or margin in TextView or parent container
- Line height or line spacing issues causing vertical text overlap
- Layout constraints preventing TextView from expanding vertically
- Parent container height restrictions limiting TextView expansion

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Research piece detail view layout and TextView implementation
- [ ] Identify specific layout file and TextView used for piece titles in detail view
- [ ] Analyze TextView constraints, padding, and height parameters
- [ ] Document root cause of vertical text clipping issue
- [ ] Test with various title lengths to understand clipping behavior
- [ ] Compare with other multi-line text implementations in the app
- [ ] Implement fix to ensure full title visibility with proper spacing
- [ ] Verify fix works across different screen sizes and orientations
- [ ] Test that fix doesn't break layout for shorter titles
- [ ] Ensure consistent text appearance with rest of app design

### Phase 4: Add Edit Functionality to Pieces Tab
**Status:** üé´ Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-30  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Add edit functionality to the Pieces tab by implementing an edit icon/button that allows users to modify existing pieces. Users should be able to edit the piece title/name and change the item type between "Piece" and "Technique".

**Feature Requirements:**
- **Edit Icon/Button**: Add edit icon or button to each piece in the Pieces tab list
- **Edit Dialog/Screen**: Create edit interface that allows modification of piece properties
- **Editable Fields**:
  - **Piece Title/Name**: Allow users to rename the piece
  - **Item Type**: Allow switching between "Piece" and "Technique" types
- **Save/Cancel Actions**: Provide save and cancel options for edit operations
- **Validation**: Ensure proper validation of edited fields (non-empty title, valid type selection)

**Technical Context:**
- Current Pieces tab likely only shows piece information without edit capability
- Need to add edit UI elements to existing piece list items
- Requires edit dialog/fragment or screen for modification interface
- Must integrate with existing `PieceOrTechnique` entity and repository update methods
- Should maintain consistency with Add Piece functionality and UI patterns

**Investigation Required:**
- Analyze current Pieces tab implementation and layout structure
- Identify where to add edit icon/button in piece list items
- Research existing Add Piece implementation for consistency and code reuse
- Examine `PieceOrTechnique` entity structure and update methods in repository
- Check if edit functionality already exists elsewhere in the app
- Determine best UI pattern (dialog, bottom sheet, or separate screen) for edit interface

**Design Considerations:**
- **Edit Icon Placement**: Position edit icon consistently within piece list items
- **UI Consistency**: Match design patterns used in Add Piece functionality
- **Type Selection**: Provide clear interface for switching between Piece/Technique
- **User Experience**: Ensure intuitive edit workflow with proper feedback
- **Data Integrity**: Maintain piece statistics and activity associations during edits

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Add edit icon/button to piece list item layout
- Create edit dialog/fragment with title and type editing capabilities
- Implement edit functionality in PiecesViewModel
- Update repository methods if needed for piece modification
- Add proper validation and error handling
- Ensure UI updates reflect changes immediately after edit
- Maintain favorite status and statistics during edits

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Research current Pieces tab implementation and UI structure
- [ ] Analyze existing Add Piece functionality for design patterns and code reuse
- [ ] Design edit UI interface (dialog, bottom sheet, or screen approach)
- [ ] Identify optimal placement for edit icon/button in piece list items
- [ ] Examine `PieceOrTechnique` entity and repository update methods
- [ ] Plan integration with existing PiecesViewModel and data flow
- [ ] Implement edit icon/button in Pieces tab list items
- [ ] Create edit dialog/interface with title and type modification capabilities
- [ ] Add edit functionality to PiecesViewModel with proper validation
- [ ] Ensure edited pieces update immediately in the UI
- [ ] Test editing piece titles with various lengths and special characters
- [ ] Test switching between Piece and Technique types
- [ ] Verify that piece statistics and activity associations are preserved during edits
- [ ] Ensure favorite status is maintained during piece edits
- [ ] Test edit functionality across different screen sizes and orientations
- [ ] Validate proper error handling for invalid inputs (empty titles, etc.)
