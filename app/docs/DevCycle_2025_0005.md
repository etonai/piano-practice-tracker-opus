### Phase 2: Testing-Only Button Visibility Control
**Status:** Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-27  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Implement build-variant conditional visibility for testing/development buttons in Settings screen. Hide Add Activity, Add Piece, Manage Favorites, and Connect to Google Drive buttons (and accompanying text) in production builds while keeping them visible in testing builds, following the existing pattern used by the purge data button.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Identify and analyze existing purge data button visibility implementation pattern
- [ ] Apply same visibility control pattern to Add Activity button in Settings
- [ ] Apply same visibility control pattern to Add Piece button in Settings  
- [ ] Apply same visibility control pattern to Manage Favorites button in Settings
- [ ] Apply same visibility control pattern to Connect to Google Drive button in Settings
- [ ] Apply same visibility control pattern to Connect to Google Drive text/description in Settings
- [ ] Verify all buttons and text are visible in debug/testing builds
- [ ] Verify all buttons and text are hidden in release/production builds
- [ ] Ensure build configuration maintains existing functionality for testing
- [ ] Update any related documentation or comments in code

**Technical Implementation Details:**

**Build Variant Visibility Pattern:**
```kotlin
// Follow existing pattern used by purge data button
// Likely implementation in Settings fragment/activity:

if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) {
    // Show testing buttons and text in debug builds
    addActivityButton.visibility = View.VISIBLE
    addPieceButton.visibility = View.VISIBLE
    manageFavoritesButton.visibility = View.VISIBLE
    connectGoogleDriveButton.visibility = View.VISIBLE
    googleDriveDescriptionText.visibility = View.VISIBLE
} else {
    // Hide testing buttons and text in release builds
    addActivityButton.visibility = View.GONE
    addPieceButton.visibility = View.GONE
    manageFavoritesButton.visibility = View.GONE
    connectGoogleDriveButton.visibility = View.GONE
    googleDriveDescriptionText.visibility = View.GONE
}
```

**Files to Modify:**
- Settings screen layout file (location TBD - needs codebase inspection)
- Settings fragment/activity (location TBD - needs codebase inspection)
- Build configuration files if needed (build.gradle.kts)

**Files to Create:**

2. **Visibility Implementation** (1 day): Apply conditional visibility to four target buttons and Google Drive text
3. **Build Testing** (0.5 days): Test visibility in both debug and release builds
4. **Code Review & Polish** (0.5 days): Ensure consistency and clean implementation

### Phase 3: Import/Export Button Text Corrections
**Status:** Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-27  
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:** Update import and export button text to accurately reflect current functionality. Change "Import Activities from CSV" and "Export Activities to CSV" to "Import Data" and "Export Data" to reflect that the features now support both activities and pieces, and both CSV and JSON formats.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Change "Import Activities from CSV" button text to "Import Data"
- [ ] Change "Export Activities to CSV" button text to "Export Data" 
- [ ] Verify button text changes don't break layout or styling
- [ ] Ensure accessibility labels and content descriptions are updated if needed
- [ ] Update any related help text or tooltips to reflect new functionality
- [ ] Test button functionality remains unchanged after text updates

**Technical Implementation Details:**

**Button Text Updates:**
```xml
<!-- Update in Import/Export layout file -->
<!-- Before: -->
<Button
    android:text="Import Activities from CSV"
    android:contentDescription="Import Activities from CSV" />
    
<Button
    android:text="Export Activities to CSV"
    android:contentDescription="Export Activities to CSV" />

<!-- After: -->
<Button
    android:text="Import Data"
    android:contentDescription="Import data from CSV or JSON file" />
    
<Button
    android:text="Export Data"
    android:contentDescription="Export data to CSV or JSON file" />
```

**Files to Modify:**
- Import/Export screen layout file (location TBD - needs codebase inspection)
- `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` (if button text is externalized)
- Any related help or dialog text that references old functionality

**Files to Create:**
- None (text-only updates)

**User Experience Features:**
- **Accurate Labeling**: Button text now reflects true functionality (data vs. activities only)
- **Format Flexibility**: Text indicates support for multiple formats (CSV and JSON)
- **Clear Intent**: "Import Data" and "Export Data" are more concise and clear
- **Accessibility**: Updated content descriptions provide accurate information for screen readers
- **Consistency**: Aligns button text with actual feature capabilities from DevCycle_2025_0004

**Implementation Sub-Phases:**
1. **Text Location Discovery** (0.25 days): Locate all import/export button text references
2. **Text Updates** (0.5 days): Update button text and accessibility labels
3. **Layout Verification** (0.25 days): Ensure text changes don't affect button sizing or layout
4. **Testing** (0.25 days): Verify functionality and accessibility after changes

### Phase 4: Timeline Tab Evaluation - Temporary Removal
**Status:** Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-27  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Temporarily hide the Timeline tab and disable Timeline data population to evaluate user preference for Calendar Activities Detail Mode vs. separate Timeline functionality. Comment out Timeline features while preserving code for quick restoration if needed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Hide Timeline tab from main navigation without removing underlying code
- [ ] Comment out Timeline data population logic to prevent unnecessary database queries
- [ ] Disable Timeline fragment initialization and lifecycle methods
- [ ] Ensure app navigation works properly without Timeline tab
- [ ] Comment out Timeline-related ViewModels and repository methods rather than deleting
- [ ] Verify Calendar Activities Detail Mode provides adequate Timeline functionality replacement
- [ ] Document restoration process for quick Timeline re-enabling if needed
- [ ] Test app stability and performance with Timeline functionality disabled

**Technical Implementation Details:**

**Timeline Tab Hiding Strategy:**
```kotlin
// In main navigation setup (likely MainFragment or Navigation component)
// Comment out Timeline tab registration:

/*
// Timeline Tab - Temporarily disabled for evaluation
binding.bottomNavigation.menu.add(Menu.NONE, R.id.timeline_fragment, Menu.NONE, "Timeline")
    .setIcon(R.drawable.ic_timeline)
*/

// Or if using ViewPager with tabs:
/*
// Timeline tab setup - temporarily disabled
viewPagerAdapter.addFragment(TimelineFragment(), "Timeline")
*/
```

**Timeline Data Population Disabling:**
```kotlin
// In repository or relevant data loading methods:
// Comment out Timeline-specific data queries:

/*
// Timeline data loading - temporarily disabled for evaluation
fun loadTimelineData(): LiveData<List<TimelineItem>> {
    return timelineDao.getAllTimelineItems()
}
*/

// In ViewModels:
/*
// Timeline ViewModel data loading - temporarily disabled
private val timelineData = repository.loadTimelineData()
*/
```

**Timeline Fragment Commenting:**
```kotlin
// In TimelineFragment:
/*
// Timeline Fragment functionality - temporarily disabled for evaluation
override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState)
    // Implementation commented out
}
*/
```

**Files to Modify:**
- Main navigation setup file (location TBD - needs codebase inspection)
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/TimelineFragment.kt` (comment out methods)
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/TimelineViewModel.kt` (comment out data loading)
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/data/repository/PianoRepository.kt` (comment out Timeline queries)
- Navigation graph or ViewPager adapter files
- Bottom navigation menu files

**Files to Create:**
- None (preservation-focused approach using comments)

**User Experience Features:**
- **Clean Navigation**: Users see streamlined navigation without Timeline option
- **Performance Optimization**: No Timeline data queries reduce database load
- **Calendar Focus**: Users directed to Calendar Activities Detail Mode for activity viewing
- **Quick Restoration**: All Timeline code preserved via comments for easy re-enabling
- **Evaluation Ready**: Clean test environment to assess user preference and app performance

**Implementation Sub-Phases:**
1. **Navigation Analysis** (0.5 days): Identify all Timeline tab navigation references
2. **Data Query Disabling** (0.5 days): Comment out Timeline data population and queries
3. **Fragment Commenting** (0.5 days): Comment out Timeline fragment functionality while preserving code
4. **Testing & Validation** (0.5 days): Verify app works properly without Timeline and performance is improved
5. **Documentation** (0.25 days): Document restoration process for potential Timeline re-enabling

### Phase 5: Fix Suggestions Display Bugs
**Status:** Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-27  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Fix critical bugs in practice suggestions display. Free users are seeing too many favorite suggestions (4 instead of 1), and there's inconsistency between Dashboard suggestions (3 favorites) and Suggestions tab (4 favorites). Both screens should show the same suggestions with proper free user limits applied.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Investigate why free users see 4 favorite suggestions instead of 1 in Suggestions tab
- [ ] Investigate why Dashboard shows 3 favorite suggestions vs. Suggestions tab showing 4
- [ ] Fix favorite suggestion limits to enforce 1 favorite for free users, 4 for Pro users
- [ ] Ensure Dashboard and Suggestions tab show identical suggestion sets
- [ ] Verify non-favorite suggestion limits work correctly (2 for free, 4 for Pro)
- [ ] Test with both free and Pro user modes to confirm proper limits
- [ ] Ensure suggestion algorithms between Dashboard and Suggestions tab are synchronized
- [ ] Fix any Pro user status detection issues if present

**Technical Implementation Details:**

**Root Cause Analysis Required:**
```kotlin
// SuggestionsViewModel.kt lines 114 & 169 show correct limits:
val favoriteLimit = if (proUserManager.isProUser()) 4 else 1  // Should be 1 for free
val nonFavoriteLimit = if (proUserManager.isProUser()) 4 else 2  // Should be 2 for free

// Potential issues to investigate:
// 1. ProUserManager.isProUser() returning incorrect value
// 2. Dashboard using different suggestion logic than Suggestions tab
// 3. Fallback logic (lines 117-166) overriding limits incorrectly
// 4. Multiple suggestion sources causing limit bypass
```

**Dashboard vs. Suggestions Tab Consistency:**
```kotlin
// Dashboard suggestion logic location TBD - needs codebase inspection
// Must ensure Dashboard uses same:
// - ProUserManager.isProUser() check
// - favoriteLimit and nonFavoriteLimit values  
// - Suggestion filtering and sorting algorithms
// - Exclusion criteria (pieces practiced today, etc.)
```

**Free User Limit Enforcement:**
```kotlin
// Verify these limits are strictly enforced:
// Free users: 1 favorite + 2 non-favorite = 3 total practice suggestions
// Pro users: 4 favorites + 4 non-favorites = 8 total practice suggestions

// Check fallback logic doesn't exceed limits:
if (favoriteSuggestions.size < favoriteLimit) {
    // Ensure fallback additions don't exceed favoriteLimit
    val neededCount = favoriteLimit - favoriteSuggestions.size
    // Fallback must respect this limit
}
```

**Files to Investigate:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/SuggestionsViewModel.kt` (favorite limit logic)
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/utils/ProUserManager.kt` (Pro status detection)
- Dashboard fragment/ViewModel (location TBD - needs discovery for suggestion logic)
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/SuggestionsFragment.kt` (display logic)

**Files to Modify:**
- SuggestionsViewModel.kt (if fallback logic exceeds limits)
- Dashboard suggestion logic files (TBD after discovery)
- ProUserManager.kt (if Pro status detection is incorrect)
- Any shared suggestion utility classes (TBD after discovery)

**User Experience Features:**
- **Correct Free Limits**: Free users see exactly 1 favorite + 2 non-favorite suggestions
- **Consistent Display**: Dashboard and Suggestions tab show identical suggestion sets
- **Pro User Support**: Pro users continue to see 4 favorites + 4 non-favorites correctly
- **Reliable Status Detection**: Pro user status correctly determined and applied
- **Performance**: No unnecessary suggestion calculations or database queries

**Implementation Sub-Phases:**
1. **Root Cause Analysis** (1 day): Investigate Pro status detection and suggestion limit enforcement
2. **Dashboard Discovery** (0.5 days): Locate Dashboard suggestion logic and compare with Suggestions tab
3. **Bug Fixes** (1-2 days): Fix limit enforcement and synchronize suggestion algorithms
4. **Testing & Validation** (0.5 days): Test with both free and Pro modes to verify correct limits

**Critical Investigation Points:**
- Current Pro user status: Check if app incorrectly detects user as Pro
- Fallback logic in SuggestionsViewModel: Verify it respects favoriteLimit  
- Dashboard suggestion source: Identify if Dashboard uses different suggestion logic
- Suggestion counting: Confirm suggestions are properly counted against limits
