**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-01-28  
**Date Implemented:** 2025-01-28  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Add a quick add activity feature to the Calendar tab for Pro users. When viewing activity details in calendar mode, Pro users should see a "+" icon next to each activity that allows them to quickly add a new activity for the same piece, similar to the existing functionality in the Suggestions tab.
**Build Version:** 1.0.8.21-beta
**Implementation Notes:**
- Added `addActivityButton` to `item_timeline_activity.xml` layout (initially hidden)
- Updated `CalendarActivitiesAdapter` to accept `onAddActivityClick` callback and `ProUserManager`
- Modified `CalendarFragment.bindActivityView()` to show/hide add button based on Pro status
- Add button opens `QuickAddActivityDialogFragment` with piece pre-filled, matching Suggestions functionality
- Button positioned before edit/delete buttons for logical workflow
**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/res/layout/item_timeline_activity.xml:49-58` - Added add activity button
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/CalendarActivitiesAdapter.kt:19-24,33-48,100-108` - Added Pro user check and callback

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Add "+" button to calendar activity items for Pro users only
- [x] Clicking the "+" button opens the QuickAddActivityDialogFragment with the piece pre-filled
- [x] Button should only be visible to Pro users (free users don't see it)
- [x] Functionality should match the existing Suggestions quick add behavior
- [x] Proper spacing and visual integration with existing edit/delete buttons
- [x] Test the quick add dialog opens correctly with the correct piece information
- [x] Verify Pro user check works correctly (show/hide button based on Pro status)
- [x] Ensure consistent UI styling with other quick add implementations

### Phase 5: Optimize Suggestions Performance Using Piece Last Activity Dates
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-01-28  
**Date Initial Implementation:** 2025-01-28  
**Date Resumed:** 2025-01-28  
**Date Completed:** 2025-01-28  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Optimize the suggestions algorithm to use the `lastPracticeDate` and `lastPerformanceDate` fields from the PieceOrTechnique entity instead of querying and processing all activities from the database. This will improve performance and handle pruned activity records correctly by using piece metadata instead of database queries.
**Build Version:** 1.0.8.21-beta
**Implementation Notes:**
- **Issue Identified**: Initial implementation was premature and needs refinement
- **Root Problem**: Suggestions display "last practice/performance" information that should come from piece fields, not database queries
- **Critical for**: Handling pruned activity records correctly and improving performance
- **Final Implementation**: Completed optimization of all last activity date queries throughout suggestions system
- Replaced all `maxByOrNull` operations for finding last practice/performance dates with direct piece field access
- Performance suggestions now use piece fields for last activity display while still counting recent practices for eligibility
- All suggestion reason text now uses optimized piece field data instead of expensive database queries
**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/SuggestionsViewModel.kt:49-301` - Fully optimized suggestion algorithm
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/DashboardViewModel.kt:129-131,224-246,300-340,372-410,453-455` - Optimized Dashboard suggestions to use piece fields
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Update SuggestionsViewModel to use piece.lastPracticeDate and piece.lastPerformanceDate instead of querying activities
- [x] For last activity date, use the most recent between lastPracticeDate and lastPerformanceDate
- [x] Maintain existing suggestion logic and criteria (favorites, days since last activity, etc.)
- [x] Remove the maxByOrNull operations to find last activity for all suggestions
- [x] Verify suggestion reasons display correct activity type (practice vs performance)
- [x] Verify all suggestion displays use piece fields instead of database queries for last activity dates
- [x] Ensure performance suggestions work correctly with optimized approach
- [x] Update DashboardViewModel to use piece fields for all suggestion displays
- [x] Test that suggestion ordering and filtering logic remains unchanged
- [x] Confirm suggestions work correctly with pruned activity records
- [x] Confirm no regression in suggestion accuracy or functionality

### Phase 6: Consolidate Dashboard and Suggestions Tab Algorithm
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Date Added:** 2025-01-28  
**Date Implemented:** 2025-01-28  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Consolidate the suggestions algorithm code between DashboardViewModel and SuggestionsViewModel into a single shared source. Currently, both classes have duplicate suggestion generation logic, which leads to inconsistencies when changes are made to one location but not the other. By creating a single source for the suggestions algorithm, future adjustments will automatically apply to both Dashboard and Suggestions tabs.
**Build Version:** 1.0.8.21-beta
**Implementation Notes:**
- Created SuggestionsService class to centralize all suggestion generation logic
- Extracted practice suggestions algorithm with favorites/non-favorites logic, Pro user limits, and fallback mechanisms
- Extracted performance suggestions algorithm with tier-based sorting and Level 4 practice requirements
- Both DashboardViewModel and SuggestionsViewModel now use shared service instead of duplicate code
- All existing suggestion behavior preserved: Pro user limits, favorite star prefixes, activity date calculations
- Future changes to suggestion algorithms will automatically apply to both Dashboard and Suggestions tabs
**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/SuggestionsService.kt` - New shared service with all suggestion algorithms
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/DashboardViewModel.kt:19,96-97,103-104` - Updated to use shared service
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/progress/SuggestionsViewModel.kt:33,38-39` - Updated to use shared service
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Create shared suggestions service with all algorithm logic
- [x] Extract practice suggestions algorithm to shared service
- [x] Extract performance suggestions algorithm to shared service (Pro users only)
- [x] Extract favorite/non-favorite filtering logic to shared service
- [x] Update DashboardViewModel to use shared service instead of duplicate code
- [x] Update SuggestionsViewModel to use shared service instead of duplicate code
- [x] Verify Dashboard suggestions behavior remains identical after refactor
- [x] Verify Suggestions tab behavior remains identical after refactor
- [x] Confirm Pro user limits work correctly in both locations
- [x] Test that future changes to shared service affect both Dashboard and Suggestions tabs
