# Development Cycle 2025-0007

**Status:** In Progress  
**Start Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Focus:** Manual Testing and User Validation

## Overview

This development cycle focuses on comprehensive manual testing by the user to validate the PlayStreak application functionality, user experience, and identify any issues before proceeding to production release. This cycle serves as a critical validation step to ensure the app meets quality standards and user expectations.

## Current Work Items

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Manual Testing and Validation
**Status:** Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-01-27  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** Conduct thorough manual testing of all application features, user experience, edge cases, and cross-device compatibility to ensure the app works as expected across all scenarios.
**Build Version:** 1.0.8.21-beta
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Test activity logging functionality (add, edit, delete activities)
- [ ] Test piece/technique management (add, edit, delete pieces)
- [ ] Test progress tracking and statistics
- [ ] Test calendar view functionality
- [ ] Test favorites and quick access features
- [ ] Test data import/export functionality

- [ ] Validate data persistence and app state management
- [ ] Test with large datasets (many activities, pieces)
- [ ] Test app behavior with limited storage/memory
- [ ] Test rapid user interactions and input validation
- [ ] Test app behavior during configuration changes
- [ ] Test data integrity during app updates
- [ ] Test on different Android versions (API levels)
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes and densities
- [ ] Test on devices with different hardware capabilities
- [ ] Test app behavior with different system settings
- [ ] Validate consistent functionality across devices
