# Development Cycle 2025-0007

**Status:** In Progress  
**Start Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Focus:** Manual Testing and User Validation

## Overview

This development cycle focuses on comprehensive manual testing by the user to validate the PlayStreak application functionality, user experience, and identify any issues before proceeding to production release. This cycle serves as a critical validation step to ensure the app meets quality standards and user expectations.

## Current Work Items

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Manual Testing and Validation
**Status:** Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-01-27  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** Conduct thorough manual testing of all application features, user experience, edge cases, and cross-device compatibility to ensure the app works as expected across all scenarios.
**Build Version:** 1.0.8.21-beta
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Test activity logging functionality (add, edit, delete activities)
- [ ] Test piece/technique management (add, edit, delete pieces)
- [ ] Test progress tracking and statistics
- [ ] Test calendar view functionality
- [ ] Test favorites and quick access features
- [ ] Test data import/export functionality
- [ ] Test configuration and settings
- [ ] Test navigation flow and screen transitions
- [ ] Validate UI responsiveness and layout on different screen sizes
- [ ] Evaluate visual design consistency and appeal
- [ ] Validate data persistence and app state management
- [ ] Test with large datasets (many activities, pieces)
- [ ] Test app behavior with limited storage/memory
- [ ] Test rapid user interactions and input validation
- [ ] Test app behavior during configuration changes
- [ ] Test data integrity during app updates
- [ ] Test on different Android versions (API levels)
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes and densities
- [ ] Test on devices with different hardware capabilities
- [ ] Test app behavior with different system settings
- [ ] Validate consistent functionality across devices
- [ ] Document any bugs, issues, UX problems, performance issues, crashes, or device-specific limitations discovered

### Phase 2: Import/Export JSON Functionality Testing
**Status:** Open  
**Date Added:** 2025-01-27  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Test the Import/Export functionality to ensure it properly uses JSON format in production mode and handles the streamlined user experience correctly. **IMPORTANT:** Regular builds do NOT provide format choice - import/export automatically uses JSON format only. Note: Test/debug builds will still use the current options with CSV/JSON choice.
**Build Version:** 1.0.8.21-beta
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Test export functionality in production mode (should default to JSON format)
- [ ] Test import functionality in production mode (should default to JSON format)
- [ ] Verify that import/export buttons proceed directly to next step without format selection in production mode
- [ ] Confirm that regular builds do NOT show format selection options
- [ ] Test JSON export file format and structure
- [ ] Test JSON import with valid data files
- [ ] Test JSON import with invalid/malformed data files
- [ ] Test import/export with large datasets
- [ ] Test import/export with special characters and Unicode data
- [ ] Verify data integrity after import/export operations
- [ ] Test error handling for import failures
- [ ] Test export file naming and storage location
- [ ] Document any issues with JSON format handling or user experience

## Cycle Notes

- This cycle serves as a critical validation step before production release
- Focus on real-world usage scenarios and user workflows
- All testing should be documented with detailed steps and results
- Issues discovered should be prioritized and tracked for resolution
- This testing phase is essential for ensuring app quality and user satisfaction

## Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Install and launch app successfully
- [ ] Navigate through all main screens
- [ ] Perform core user workflows (add activity, view progress, etc.)
- [ ] Test data entry and validation
- [ ] Test data persistence across app restarts
- [ ] Test app behavior with different user scenarios
- [ ] Document any unexpected behavior or issues

### Bug Reporting Format
For each issue discovered, document:
- **Issue Title:** Brief description of the problem
- **Steps to Reproduce:** Detailed steps to recreate the issue
- **Expected Behavior:** What should happen
- **Actual Behavior:** What actually happens
- **Device/OS:** Device model and Android version
- **Severity:** Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **Screenshots:** If applicable

## Future Cycles

After manual testing completion, the next cycle will focus on:
- Bug fixes and issue resolution
- UX improvements based on testing feedback
- Performance optimizations if needed
- Final preparation for production release
