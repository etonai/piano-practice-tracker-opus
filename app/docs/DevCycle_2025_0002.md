**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-07-24)  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-24  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Ensure the activity limit is enforced when manually adding a new activity. Currently, the limit is only enforced during import, not manual addition. (See Ticket #4)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- ✅ Tapping the icon prompts for confirmation ("Delete this piece and all its activities?").
- ✅ On confirmation, delete the piece and all associated activities from the database.
- ✅ The Pieces tab and Timeline update to reflect the deletion.
- ❌ TODO: Add tests to verify correct deletion and data integrity.

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Approach:** Added database cascade deletion, UI trash icon, confirmation dialog with clear messaging
- **Impact:** Improved data management and user control over their piece library
- **Effort:** Medium (2-3 hours including UI and database changes)

#### Phase 6 Completion Summary (2025-07-24)

**✅ Successfully Completed:**
- Trash icon added to each piece item in the Pieces tab
- Confirmation dialog shows piece name and activity count before deletion
