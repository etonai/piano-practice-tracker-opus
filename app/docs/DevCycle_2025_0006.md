# Development Cycle 2025-0006

**Status:** Planning  
**Start Date:** 2025-07-27  
**Focus:** TBD

## Overview

This development cycle will build upon the completed user experience enhancements from DevCycle_2025_0005. The specific focus and work items are to be determined based on priorities identified from the completed phases and ongoing evaluation needs.

## Current Work Items

*No phases currently defined. Development priorities to be determined based on:*
- Results from DevCycle_2025_0005 Timeline tab evaluation
- User feedback from build 1.0.8.20-beta testing
- Performance monitoring data
- Strategic development priorities

## Success Criteria

*To be defined when phases are added*

## Cycle Notes

- DevCycle_2025_0006 builds upon the completed user experience foundation from DevCycle_2025_0005
- All phases from DevCycle_2025_0005 were successfully completed on 2025-07-27
- DevCycle_2025_0005 completed: statistics display, testing button visibility, import/export text corrections, Timeline removal, and suggestions bug fixes
- Testing completed with build 1.0.8.20-beta for all DevCycle_2025_0005 features
- Timeline tab evaluation from Phase 4 may influence future development decisions
- No phases currently defined - awaiting priority determination and planning

## Future Cycles

Next development cycle (2025-0007) will likely focus on:
- Production release and post-launch activities
- User feedback implementation 
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Feature enhancements based on real usage data

## Questions

### Implementation Planning Questions

**Q1: Development Priorities**
What should be the primary focus areas for DevCycle_2025_0006?

*Considerations:*
- Timeline tab restoration decision based on user feedback
- Advanced analytics and practice insights using Phase 1 piece statistics from DevCycle_2025_0005
- Additional user experience polish and refinements
- Performance optimizations based on Timeline removal evaluation
- Preparation for production release readiness

**Q2: Timeline Tab Evaluation Results**
Based on user feedback and performance data from DevCycle_2025_0005 Phase 4, should the Timeline tab be:
- Permanently removed to maintain clean navigation and performance benefits
- Restored with improvements based on Calendar Activities Detail Mode learnings
- Kept disabled pending further evaluation

*Considerations:*
- User preference for Calendar Activities Detail Mode vs. separate Timeline
- Performance impact of Timeline data loading
- Navigation simplification benefits
- Development effort for restoration vs. alternative improvements

**Q3: Feature Enhancement Priority**
What new features or improvements should be prioritized for this cycle?

*Considerations:*
- Advanced practice analytics using piece statistics infrastructure
- Export/import enhancements beyond CSV/JSON support
- User interface polish and accessibility improvements
- Pro user feature development
- Database performance optimizations
