# Development Cycle 2025-0004

**Status:** In Progress  
**Start Date:** 2025-07-26  
**Focus:** Performance Optimization and User Experience Enhancement

## Overview

This development cycle focuses on significant performance improvements and user experience enhancements for PlayStreak. The cycle addresses two major areas: database optimization through independent piece information storage, and calendar interface enhancement with verbose mode functionality.

## Current Work Items

### Phase 1: Independent Piece Information Storage
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Date Added:** 2025-07-26  
**Date Completed:** 2025-07-26  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Implement independent storage of piece statistics and information to reduce database query overhead and improve app performance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Design and implement enhanced PieceOrTechnique entity with statistical fields
- [x] Create database migration to populate statistics from existing activities  
- [x] Modify activity CRUD operations to maintain piece statistics
- [x] Replace expensive activity-based queries with direct piece statistics queries
- [x] Validate data integrity and performance improvements
- [x] Implement favorites storage using existing isFavorite field in PieceOrTechnique entity
- [x] Implement import/export strategy for piece statistics
- [x] Determine export format (JSON vs. CSV) for statistics data

**Technical Implementation Details:**

**Database Schema Enhancement:**
```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "pieces")
data class Piece(
    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true) val id: Int = 0,
    val name: String,
    val type: ItemType,
    val dateCreated: Long,
    
    // New independent statistics fields
    val practiceCount: Int = 0,
    val performanceCount: Int = 0,
    val lastPracticeDate: Long? = null,
    val secondLastPracticeDate: Long? = null,
    val thirdLastPracticeDate: Long? = null,
    val lastPerformanceDate: Long? = null,
    val secondLastPerformanceDate: Long? = null,
    val thirdLastPerformanceDate: Long? = null,
    val lastSatisfactoryPractice: Long? = null,
    val lastSatisfactoryPerformance: Long? = null,
    val lastUpdated: Long = System.currentTimeMillis(),
    
    // Favorites storage
    val isFavorite: Boolean = false
)
```

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/data/entities/Piece.kt`

- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/pieces/PiecesViewModel.kt`

**Activity Addition Implementation Notes:**
When a user adds an activity, the data for the associated piece will need to be updated:
- Update appropriate last date fields (`lastPracticeDate` or `lastPerformanceDate`)
- Update the second and third last date fields by shifting existing dates and adding the new timestamp
- Update `lastSatisfactory*` fields if the activity level indicates satisfactory performance:
  - For practices: Update `lastSatisfactoryPractice` if activity level is 4 (Satisfactory)
  - For performances: Update `lastSatisfactoryPerformance` if activity level is 3 (Satisfactory)
- Increment the appropriate count field (`practiceCount` or `performanceCount`)
- Update `lastUpdated` timestamp to current time

**Expected Performance Benefits:**
- Piece-related queries execute in <50ms (down from current 200ms+)
- Faster piece list loading with pre-calculated statistics
- Improved suggestions performance with cached activity data
- Scalable architecture that maintains performance as database grows

**Implementation Summary:**

## Questions

**Note:** Phase 2 "Enhanced Piece Detail Display" was added on 2025-07-27 between the original phases. Original Phase 2 is now Phase 3, and original Phase 3 is now Phase 4.

### Phase 1: Independent Piece Information Storage

**Q1: Favorites Storage Strategy**
Should we store favorite piece information separately (dedicated favorites table) or keep favorite status as a field within the pieces table?

*Considerations:*
- Separate table: More normalized, easier to query favorites independently
- Piece field: Simpler schema, fewer joins, but piece table becomes larger

EDNOTE: Separate table

**Q2: Import/Export Strategy**
Should we import/export piece statistics information separately from activities, or bundle them together?

*Considerations:*
- Separate export: Clean data separation, user choice of what to backup
- Bundled export: Simpler user experience, ensures data consistency
- Hybrid approach: Main export includes everything, option for separate exports

EDNOTE: Bundled export

**Q3: Export Format for Statistics**
Should we export piece statistics data as JSON or CSV format?

*Considerations:*
- JSON: Better for complex nested data, preserves data types, more flexible
- CSV: User-friendly for spreadsheet analysis, consistent with current export format
- Both formats: Maximum compatibility but more implementation complexity

EDNOTE: JSON

### Phase 4: Verbose Calendar Mode Toggle

**Q4: Timeline Tab Retention**
Should we keep the Timeline tab as an option, or completely replace it with Verbose Calendar Mode?

*Considerations:*
- Some users may prefer chronological list view
- Timeline may be better for searching across long date ranges
- Calendar provides better visual context for practice patterns

EDNOTE: Keep the timeline tab. 

**Q5: Default Mode**
Should Verbose Calendar Mode be the default for new users, or should users opt-in?

*Considerations:*
- New users may benefit from more information immediately
- Verbose mode may be overwhelming for casual users
- Power users likely prefer detailed information

EDNOTE: Add a Configuration button on the Settings page. ON this new Configuration page, add a toggle for Verbose Calendar. Default to non verbose calendar.

**Q6: Performance with Large Datasets**
How should we handle performance when users have hundreds of activities per month?

*Considerations:*
- Pagination or lazy loading for activity details
- Limit visible activities per day in verbose mode
- Provide filtering options within calendar view

EDNOTE: Pagination for activity details. Limit to 50 activities per page.

## Implementation Questions

### Phase 1: Database Migration & Data Consistency

**Q7: Database Migration Strategy**
What is the recovery strategy if the database migration fails partway through with a large dataset?

*Considerations:*
- Should we implement checkpointing during migration? No
- How do we rollback if migration fails after partial completion? Yes
- Should we backup the database before migration? Yes
- What's the approach for very large datasets (10,000+ activities)? There are no datasets that large

EDNOTE: If database migration fails then we will stop. We will fix the migration code and try again. There is only one user right now, so we do not have to elegantly handle migration failures.

**Q8: Data Consistency & Transactions**
How do we ensure atomicity when updating both activities and piece statistics?

*Considerations:*
- Should activity insertion and piece statistics update be in a single transaction? Yes
- What happens if piece statistics update fails after activity is inserted? Show an error, revert the activity insert.
- How do we handle concurrent access scenarios? We do not need to worry about this
- Should we implement compensation logic for failed updates? NO

**Q9: Activity Deletion & Editing Logic**
The document covers activity addition, but what about deletion and editing of activities?

*Considerations:*
- How do we update piece statistics when activities are deleted? - We update the appropriate count field by subtracting that particular activity. We requery the activities to fill the last* dates.
- For activity edits that change the piece, activity type, or level, how do we handle statistics updates? We update the appropriate count fields by subtracting the adding. For the rest, we query the activities.
- Should we recalculate statistics from scratch periodically to ensure accuracy? - No
- How do we handle bulk operations (deleting multiple activities)? - We do not do bulk delete yet. We will worry about that later.

**Q10: Performance of JSON Arrays**
Are JSON strings the most efficient approach for storing `lastThree*` arrays in SQLite? 
EDNOTE: No. Instead, let's replace lastThree.  We already have LastPracticeDate and LastPerformanceDate. We can add fields for 2nd last and 3rd last.

*Considerations:*
- Would separate tables for recent activities be more performant? - don't worry about that right now
- How do we efficiently query and update JSON array fields? - As I mentioned above, let's get rid of the array fields, since we know they are both size 3 arrays.
- What's the performance impact of JSON parsing on every piece query? - We will not need to parse many pieces.
- Should we consider using Room's built-in converters for collections? - Not at this time

**Q11: Data Validation Strategy**
How do we validate and repair piece statistics that may become inconsistent over time? - We will not

*Considerations:*
- Should we implement a background validation service? - No
- How do we detect and report inconsistencies to developers? - We will not
- What's the strategy for automatically repairing inconsistent data? - We will not
- Should we provide a manual "recalculate statistics" option for users? - No.

### Phase 3: JSON Import Conflicts

**Q12: ID Conflict Resolution**
How do we handle conflicts when importing JSON data with existing piece or activity IDs?
- For now, imports overwrite all data. We should save the old data, write the new data, and then delete the old data (if the new data write succeeds)

*Considerations:*
- Should we generate new IDs for conflicting pieces/activities? - NO
- How do we maintain relationships if IDs change during import? - They will not
- Should we provide user options (merge, replace, skip, rename)? - Later
- How do we handle partial imports when some data conflicts? - No partial imports

**Q13: Schema Version Compatibility**
How do we handle importing JSON exports from different app versions? - There should be conversion whenever the schema changes between app versions

*Considerations:*
- What's the strategy for forwards and backwards compatibility? - We'll worry about that when we change schemas
- How do we handle missing fields in older export formats? - Except for the CSV format, we don't
- Should we support migration of JSON schemas during import? - We don't
- What validation errors should be user-facing vs. developer-facing? - All validation errors should be both user-facing and dev-facing

### Phase 4: Calendar Performance

**Q14: Memory Management for Verbose Calendar**
How do we manage memory usage when displaying detailed activity data for entire months?
EDNOTE: I don't think this is a problem. A single user's activity for a single month should at best be in the low hundreds. We will soon be removing the timeline, so the user will only be able to see a single day's activity on one page.

*Considerations:*
- Should we implement view recycling for expanded day cells? - No
- How do we handle months with extensive activity data? - don't worry about it
- What's the strategy for lazy loading activity details? - don't worry about it
- Should we limit the number of simultaneously expanded days? - the user can only see one day at a time

**Q15: Backwards Compatibility**
What happens if users downgrade the app after the Phase 1 database migration?
- that will not happen

*Considerations:*
- Will the app crash or gracefully handle the enhanced schema? Crash
- Should we maintain compatibility fields for older app versions? No
- How do we communicate breaking changes to users? - app store
- Should we prevent downgrades after migration? - don't worry about it.

### Additional Implementation Questions

**Q16: Database Schema Inconsistency**
The Q10 EDNOTE states we should replace JSON arrays with individual date fields, but the database schema still shows `lastThreePractices` and `lastThreePerformances` as JSON strings. What should the updated schema look like?

*Considerations:*
- Should we add `secondLastPracticeDate`, `thirdLastPracticeDate`, `secondLastPerformanceDate`, `thirdLastPerformanceDate` fields? - Yes
- Should these new fields be Long? nullable like the existing last date fields? - Yes
- Do we need to update the JSON export structure to match the new schema? - Yes

**Q17: Favorites Table Structure**
Q1 EDNOTE specifies using a separate table for favorites, but no table structure is defined. What should the favorites table schema look like?

*Considerations:*
- Should it be a simple `favorites(id: String, pieceId: String, dateAdded: Long)` table? - Yes
- Should we include additional metadata like favorited date or favorite priority? - No
- How do we handle the migration of existing favorite data if any exists? - add it to the json export.

**Q18: Configuration Page Implementation**
Q5 EDNOTE mentions adding a Configuration button to Settings and creating a new Configuration page. What are the implementation details?

*Considerations:*
- Should this be a new fragment or activity? - What do you think?
- What other configuration options should be included beyond verbose calendar toggle? - None for now
- Should we create a dedicated SettingsFragment if one doesn't exist? - Yes
- How do we navigate to this new Configuration page from the existing Settings? Configuration button in the existing Settings page

**Q19: Version Compatibility Implementation**
How exactly will version compatibility checking work for imports?

*Considerations:*
- What versions should be considered compatible vs. incompatible? - for now, we will assume that all versions are compatible.
- Should we maintain a list of supported export versions? - Not yet
- What specific error message should users see for incompatible versions? - No error yet
- Should we support automatic conversion between compatible versions? - later

**Q20: Database Migration Implementation Details**
What are the specific steps for the database migration process?

*Considerations:*
- Should we create the new piece statistics fields first, then populate them? - Yes
- What's the exact SQL for calculating and populating the statistics from existing activities? - It should be easy to figure out for each piece.
- Should we migrate favorites to the separate table during this same migration? - Yes
- What's the rollback strategy if we need to revert the migration? - What do you suggest?

**Q21: Piece ID Generation Strategy**
The schema shows String IDs for pieces - how are these generated and do they relate to existing pieces?

*Considerations:*
- Are these UUIDs, auto-generated strings, or user-defined names? - Auto generated strings. They really just need to be integers
- If pieces already exist in the current system, how do we handle ID mapping during migration? - Pieces with the same name are considered the same piece
- Should piece IDs be human-readable (like piece names) or system-generated? - ids should be system generated integers, and they should increment
- How do we ensure ID uniqueness across imports and manual entry? - If there is a conflict, throw an error. If a user attempts to add a piece that already exists, disallow and give the user an error.

### Remaining Implementation Questions

**Q22: Database Schema Update Required**
The database schema still shows `id: String` and JSON array fields, but answers indicate we need integer IDs and individual date fields. What should the corrected schema look like?

*Schema Update Needed:*
```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "pieces")
data class Piece(
    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true) val id: Int = 0,
    val name: String,
    val type: ItemType,
    val dateCreated: Long,
    
    // New independent statistics fields
    val practiceCount: Int = 0,
    val performanceCount: Int = 0,
    val lastPracticeDate: Long? = null,
    val secondLastPracticeDate: Long? = null,
    val thirdLastPracticeDate: Long? = null,
    val lastPerformanceDate: Long? = null,
    val secondLastPerformanceDate: Long? = null,
    val thirdLastPerformanceDate: Long? = null,
    val lastSatisfactoryPractice: Long? = null,
    val lastSatisfactoryPerformance: Long? = null,
    val lastUpdated: Long = System.currentTimeMillis()
)
```
EDNOTE: yes

**Q23: Configuration Page Implementation Decision**
Q18 asks whether the Configuration page should be a new fragment or activity - what's the recommendation?
- What do you think?  What is a fragment vs an activity?

*Considerations:*
- Fragment: Consistent with other app navigation patterns, easier integration
- Activity: Standalone configuration experience, cleaner separation
- Current app architecture: What pattern does the existing app follow?

**Q24: Database Migration Rollback Strategy**
Q20 asks for rollback strategy suggestions - what approach should we take?

*Considerations:*
- Simple approach: Restore from backup database file created before migration
- Sophisticated approach: Implement reverse migration scripts
- Risk assessment: How likely is rollback needed given single-user scenario?
- Recovery time: How quickly do we need to restore functionality?

**Q25: JSON Export Schema Inconsistency**
The JSON export structure still shows `lastThreePractices` arrays, but we're changing to individual date fields. Should the export format be updated? - Yes

*Updated JSON Structure Needed:*
```json
"statistics": {
  "practiceCount": 15,
  "performanceCount": 3,
  "lastPracticeDate": "2025-07-25T10:30:00Z",
  "secondLastPracticeDate": "2025-07-23T14:15:00Z",
  "thirdLastPracticeDate": "2025-07-21T09:45:00Z",
  "lastPerformanceDate": "2025-07-20T15:45:00Z",
  "secondLastPerformanceDate": "2025-07-18T19:30:00Z",
  "thirdLastPerformanceDate": "2025-07-15T16:20:00Z",
  "lastSatisfactoryPractice": "2025-07-23T14:15:00Z",
  "lastSatisfactoryPerformance": "2025-07-20T15:45:00Z"
}
```

**Q26: Favorites Integration in JSON Export**
Q17 mentions adding favorites to JSON export, but the current JSON structure doesn't include favorites. How should favorites be represented in the export?
EDNOTE: We need to modify the JSON structure to include favorites.

*Considerations:*
- Include as separate "favorites" array with piece references - yes
- Include as `isFavorite` boolean field within each piece - No
- Include favorite metadata (dateAdded) in export - No
- Handle pieces that are favorited but have no activities - the favorites array will handle that

**Q27: Piece Name Uniqueness Enforcement**
Q21 states "Pieces with the same name are considered the same piece" and "disallow and give the user an error" for conflicts. How should this be implemented?

*Considerations:*
- Database constraint: UNIQUE constraint on piece name field - Sure
- Application logic: Check for existing names before insert - Yes
- User feedback: What specific error message for duplicate names? - Names must be unique
- Case sensitivity: Should "Moonlight Sonata" and "moonlight sonata" be considered the same? - Yes

### Final Implementation Questions

**Q28: Fragment vs Activity Technical Explanation**
Q23 asks for fragment vs activity explanation. Here's the technical difference and recommendation:

**Fragment:**
- UI component that represents a portion of a screen within an Activity
- Can be embedded within other Activities or fragments
- Shares the Activity's lifecycle but has its own sub-lifecycle
- Easier to integrate with existing navigation patterns
- Better for consistency with other app screens
- Can be part of a ViewPager or bottom navigation setup

**Activity:**
- Complete, standalone screen with its own lifecycle
- Independent from other Activities
- Can be launched independently from any part of the app
- More heavyweight, involves system-level operations
- Better for completely separate functionality

**Recommendation:** Use a **Fragment** for the Configuration page because:
- It's consistent with modern Android navigation patterns
- Easier to integrate with existing Settings flow
- More lightweight and flexible
- Can be easily embedded in different contexts if needed

EDNOTE: Ok, Fragment

**Q29: Database Migration Rollback Strategy**
Q24 still needs an answer. Given the single-user scenario, what's the recommended approach?

*Recommendation:*
- **Simple file backup approach**: Copy entire database file before migration
- **Quick rollback**: Replace current database with backup file if migration fails
- **Validation step**: Test migration success before deleting backup
- **User notification**: Simple error message directing user to restart app if rollback occurs

EDNOTE: Yes, do this

**Q30: Document Schema Updates Required**
Several schemas in the main document need updating to match the confirmed decisions:

1. **Main Database Schema** (lines 39-53): Still shows `id: String` and JSON arrays
2. **Main JSON Export Structure** (lines 104-127): Still shows old format with arrays and `isFavorite`
3. **Activity Implementation Notes** (lines 73-81): Still references `lastThree*` fields being removed

Should these be updated to match the confirmed schemas in the questions section?
EDNOTE: Yes.

**Q31: Favorites Table Structure**
Q17 shows `favorites(id: String, pieceId: String, dateAdded: Long)` but pieces now have integer IDs. Should this be:
```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "favorites")
data class Favorite(
    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true) val id: Int = 0,
    val pieceId: Int,
    val dateAdded: Long
)
```
EDNOTE: Yes

**Q32: Schema Duplicate Field Error**
The Q22 schema shows `lastPerformanceDate` twice (lines 513 and 516). The corrected schema should be:
```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "pieces")
data class Piece(
    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true) val id: Int = 0,
    val name: String,
    val type: ItemType,
    val dateCreated: Long,
    
    // New independent statistics fields
    val practiceCount: Int = 0,
    val performanceCount: Int = 0,
    val lastPracticeDate: Long? = null,
    val secondLastPracticeDate: Long? = null,
    val thirdLastPracticeDate: Long? = null,
    val lastPerformanceDate: Long? = null,
    val secondLastPerformanceDate: Long? = null,
    val thirdLastPerformanceDate: Long? = null,
    val lastSatisfactoryPractice: Long? = null,
    val lastSatisfactoryPerformance: Long? = null,
    val lastUpdated: Long = System.currentTimeMillis()
)
```

EDNOTE: Yes

**Q33: Complete Updated JSON Export Structure**
Based on Q25 and Q26 answers, should the complete JSON structure be:
```json
{
  "exportInfo": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "exportDate": "2025-07-26T20:30:00Z",
    "format": "combined_data",
    "appVersion": "1.0.8.16"
  },
  "pieces": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Moonlight Sonata",
      "type": "PIECE",
      "isFavorite": true,
      "statistics": {
        "practiceCount": 15,
        "performanceCount": 3,
        "lastPracticeDate": "2025-07-25T10:30:00Z",
        "secondLastPracticeDate": "2025-07-23T14:15:00Z",
        "thirdLastPracticeDate": "2025-07-21T09:45:00Z",
        "lastPerformanceDate": "2025-07-20T15:45:00Z",
        "secondLastPerformanceDate": "2025-07-18T19:30:00Z",
        "thirdLastPerformanceDate": "2025-07-15T16:20:00Z",
        "lastSatisfactoryPractice": "2025-07-23T14:15:00Z",
        "lastSatisfactoryPerformance": "2025-07-20T15:45:00Z"
      }
    }
  ],
  "activities": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "pieceId": 1,
      "timestamp": "2025-07-25T10:30:00Z",
      "activityType": "PRACTICE",
      "level": 2,
      "performanceType": "",
      "minutes": 30,
      "notes": "Working on dynamics"
    }
  ]
}
```

EDNOTE: No, let's revise this throughout the document. Instead of having a separate favorites field that has almost no information, just add isFavorite back to the Pieces data

**Q34: Case-Insensitive Name Comparison Implementation**
Q27 specifies that "Moonlight Sonata" and "moonlight sonata" should be considered the same. How should this be implemented technically?

*Considerations:*
- Database level: Use COLLATE NOCASE in SQLite schema - Yes
- Application level: Convert to lowercase before comparison - Yes
- User input: Preserve original case for display, normalize for comparison - No
- Import validation: How to handle case conflicts during JSON import - don't worry about it.

### Document Update Questions

**Q35: Favorites Storage vs Export Inconsistency**
Q1 EDNOTE says "Separate table" for favorites storage, but Q33 EDNOTE says "add isFavorite back to the Pieces data" for JSON export. This creates a contradiction:

- **Database Storage**: Separate `favorites` table (Q1, Q31)
- **JSON Export**: `isFavorite` field within pieces (Q33)

Should we implement:
1. **Database**: Store favorites in separate table for normalization
2. **JSON Export**: Include `isFavorite: true/false` field in pieces array by joining with favorites table during export
3. **JSON Import**: Read `isFavorite` field and populate the separate favorites table accordingly

This would give us the best of both approaches - normalized database storage but simple JSON structure.

EDNOTE: No longer use a separate favorites table. Treat favorites only as data attached to the piece. isFavorite

**Q36: Main Document Schema Updates Required**
Q30 EDNOTE says "Yes" to updating main document schemas, but they still show outdated information:

1. **Database Schema** (lines 39-53): Still shows `id: String` and `lastThreePractices` JSON arrays
2. **JSON Export Structure** (lines 104-127): Still shows `lastThreePractices` arrays instead of individual date fields
3. **Activity Implementation Notes** (lines 73-81): Still references removed `lastThree*` fields

Should all these be updated to match the confirmed final schemas from the questions section?

EDNOTE: Yes. Update the main document schemas.

**Q37: Configuration Page File List Missing**
Q28 confirmed using a Fragment for Configuration, but no files were added to the implementation lists. Should we add:

**Files to Create:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/configuration/ConfigurationFragment.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/configuration/ConfigurationViewModel.kt`
- `app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_configuration.xml`

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/main/MainFragment.kt` (add navigation to Configuration)
- `app/src/main/res/navigation/nav_graph.xml` (add Configuration destination)


EDNOTE: Yes


**Q38: Final JSON Export Structure Confirmation**
Based on Q33 EDNOTE, should the final JSON export structure be:

```json
{
  "exportInfo": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "exportDate": "2025-07-26T20:30:00Z",
    "format": "combined_data",
    "appVersion": "1.0.8.16"
  },
  "pieces": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Moonlight Sonata",
      "type": "PIECE",
      "isFavorite": true,
      "statistics": {
        "practiceCount": 15,
        "performanceCount": 3,
        "lastPracticeDate": "2025-07-25T10:30:00Z",
        "secondLastPracticeDate": "2025-07-23T14:15:00Z",
        "thirdLastPracticeDate": "2025-07-21T09:45:00Z",
        "lastPerformanceDate": "2025-07-20T15:45:00Z",
        "secondLastPerformanceDate": "2025-07-18T19:30:00Z",
        "thirdLastPerformanceDate": "2025-07-15T16:20:00Z",
        "lastSatisfactoryPractice": "2025-07-23T14:15:00Z",
        "lastSatisfactoryPerformance": "2025-07-20T15:45:00Z"
      }
    }
  ],
  "activities": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "pieceId": 1,
      "timestamp": "2025-07-25T10:30:00Z",
      "activityType": "PRACTICE",
      "level": 2,
      "performanceType": "",
      "minutes": 30,
      "notes": "Working on dynamics"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: No separate `favorites` array, just `isFavorite: true/false` within each piece.

EDNOTE: Yes

**Q39: Database Schema with Favorites Integration**
If we use a separate favorites table but include `isFavorite` in JSON export, do we need to add any fields to the main Piece entity for efficient querying, or should all favorite status be determined by joining with the favorites table?

```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "pieces")
data class Piece(
    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true) val id: Int = 0,
    val name: String,
    val type: ItemType,
    val dateCreated: Long,
    
    // New independent statistics fields
    val practiceCount: Int = 0,
    val performanceCount: Int = 0,
    val lastPracticeDate: Long? = null,
    val secondLastPracticeDate: Long? = null,
    val thirdLastPracticeDate: Long? = null,
    val lastPerformanceDate: Long? = null,
    val secondLastPerformanceDate: Long? = null,
    val thirdLastPerformanceDate: Long? = null,
    val lastSatisfactoryPractice: Long? = null,
    val lastSatisfactoryPerformance: Long? = null,
    val lastUpdated: Long = System.currentTimeMillis()
    
    // Should we add: val isFavorite: Boolean = false (for performance)
    // Or always join with favorites table?
)
```

EDNOTE: We are no longer using a separate favorites table.

### Critical Document Inconsistencies

**Q40: Database Schema Update Still Not Applied**
Q36 EDNOTE says "Yes. Update the main document schemas." but the main database schema (lines 39-53) still shows:
- `@PrimaryKey val id: String` (should be `@PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true) val id: Int = 0`)
- `lastThreePractices: String?` and `lastThreePerformances: String?` (should be individual date fields)
- Missing `isFavorite: Boolean = false` field (Q35 EDNOTE changed to store favorites in piece table)

**Corrected Main Database Schema Should Be:**
```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "pieces")
data class Piece(
    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true) val id: Int = 0,
    val name: String,
    val type: ItemType,
    val dateCreated: Long,
    
    // New independent statistics fields
    val practiceCount: Int = 0,
    val performanceCount: Int = 0,
    val lastPracticeDate: Long? = null,
    val secondLastPracticeDate: Long? = null,
    val thirdLastPracticeDate: Long? = null,
    val lastPerformanceDate: Long? = null,
    val secondLastPerformanceDate: Long? = null,
    val thirdLastPerformanceDate: Long? = null,
    val lastSatisfactoryPractice: Long? = null,
    val lastSatisfactoryPerformance: Long? = null,
    val lastUpdated: Long = System.currentTimeMillis(),
    
    // Favorites storage (Q35 EDNOTE: no separate table)
    val isFavorite: Boolean = false
)
```

EDNOTE: Correct the schemas. 

**Q41: JSON Export Structure Still Shows Old Format**
The main JSON export structure (lines 104-127) still shows:
- `lastThreePractices` and `lastThreePerformances` arrays (should be individual date fields)
- Current structure doesn't match Q38 EDNOTE confirmed format

**Corrected Main JSON Export Structure Should Be:**
```json
{
  "exportInfo": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "exportDate": "2025-07-26T20:30:00Z",
    "format": "combined_data",
    "appVersion": "1.0.8.16"
  },
  "pieces": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Moonlight Sonata",
      "type": "PIECE",
      "isFavorite": true,
      "statistics": {
        "practiceCount": 15,
        "performanceCount": 3,
        "lastPracticeDate": "2025-07-25T10:30:00Z",
        "secondLastPracticeDate": "2025-07-23T14:15:00Z",
        "thirdLastPracticeDate": "2025-07-21T09:45:00Z",
        "lastPerformanceDate": "2025-07-20T15:45:00Z",
        "secondLastPerformanceDate": "2025-07-18T19:30:00Z",
        "thirdLastPerformanceDate": "2025-07-15T16:20:00Z",
        "lastSatisfactoryPractice": "2025-07-23T14:15:00Z",
        "lastSatisfactoryPerformance": "2025-07-20T15:45:00Z"
      }
    }
  ],
  "activities": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "pieceId": 1,
      "timestamp": "2025-07-25T10:30:00Z",
      "activityType": "PRACTICE",
      "level": 2,
      "performanceType": "",
      "minutes": 30,
      "notes": "Working on dynamics"
    }
  ]
}
```

EDNOTE: Yes, correct the schemas. If you see lastThrePractices or lastThreePerformances anywhere, remove them.

**Q42: Activity Implementation Notes Reference Removed Fields**
Lines 73-81 still reference `lastThree*` fields that Q10 EDNOTE decided to remove:
- "Update the corresponding `lastThree*` field"
- "(either `lastThreePractices` or `lastThreePerformances`)"

EDNOTE: yes, at the time we were talking about that, but now we should ignore any lastThreePractices or lastThreePerformances

**Corrected Activity Implementation Notes Should Be:**
When a user adds an activity, the data for the associated piece will need to be updated:
- Update appropriate last date fields (`lastPracticeDate` or `lastPerformanceDate`) 
- Update the second and third last date fields by shifting existing dates and adding the new timestamp
- Update `lastSatisfactory*` fields if the activity level indicates satisfactory performance:
  - For practices: Update `lastSatisfactoryPractice` if activity level is 4 (Satisfactory)
  - For performances: Update `lastSatisfactoryPerformance` if activity level is 3 (Satisfactory)
- Increment the appropriate count field (`practiceCount` or `performanceCount`)
- Update `lastUpdated` timestamp to current time

EDNOTE: Yes

**Q43: Configuration Page Files Missing from Implementation Lists**
Q37 EDNOTE says "Yes" to adding Configuration page files, but they're not added to the main Phase 3 implementation file lists. Should the following be added?

**Phase 3 Files to Create:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/configuration/ConfigurationFragment.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/configuration/ConfigurationViewModel.kt`
- `app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_configuration.xml`

**Phase 3 Files to Modify (add to existing list):**
- `app/src/main/java/com/pseddev/playstreak/ui/main/MainFragment.kt` (add navigation to Configuration)
- `app/src/main/res/navigation/nav_graph.xml` (add Configuration destination)


EDNOTE: Yes

**Q44: Favorites Questions Now Obsolete**
Q35 EDNOTE changed to "No longer use a separate favorites table" but several questions are now obsolete:
- Q1 still says "EDNOTE: Separate table" (should be updated to "EDNOTE: isFavorite field in pieces table")
- Q17 discusses favorites table schema (now obsolete)
- Q31 shows favorites table structure (now obsolete)

Should these questions be updated or marked as obsolete to reflect the Q35 decision?

EDNOTE: During the course of answering questions, I changed my mind. If a question is obsolete, ignore it in favor of more recent information.

**Q45: Missing isFavorite in Acceptance Criteria**
Q35 EDNOTE changed favorites storage to `isFavorite` field, but Phase 1 acceptance criteria still says "Handle favorites storage strategy (separate table vs. piece field)" - should this be updated to reflect the decision?


EDNOTE: Yes.

### Final Implementation Questions

**Q46: Database Migration Data Population Strategy**
With the updated schema using individual date fields instead of JSON arrays, how should we populate the `secondLastPracticeDate`, `thirdLastPracticeDate`, `secondLastPerformanceDate`, and `thirdLastPerformanceDate` fields during migration?

*Implementation Approach:*
- Query activities for each piece, ordered by timestamp descending
- For practices: Set `lastPracticeDate` from most recent, `secondLastPracticeDate` from second most recent, etc.
- For performances: Set `lastPerformanceDate` from most recent, `secondLastPerformanceDate` from second most recent, etc.
- Handle cases where pieces have fewer than 3 activities (leave fields null)

EDNOTE: Yes, that is how you should handle it.

**Q47: Activity Update Logic Clarification**  
When adding a new activity, what's the exact logic for shifting the last/second/third date fields?

*Proposed Logic:*
```
If adding a practice activity:
- thirdLastPracticeDate = secondLastPracticeDate
- secondLastPracticeDate = lastPracticeDate  
- lastPracticeDate = new activity timestamp
```

EDNOTE: Yes, this is how you should handle it

**Q48: Case-Insensitive Piece Names Database Implementation**
Q34 confirmed using COLLATE NOCASE for case-insensitive piece name comparisons. Should this be added to the database schema?

*Updated Schema Addition:*
```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "pieces")
data class Piece(
    // ... other fields ...
    @ColumnInfo(collate = ColumnInfo.NOCASE)
    val name: String,
    // ... other fields ...
)
```

EDNOTE: Yes, this is how you should handle it

### Remaining Implementation Clarifications

**Q49: Database Migration Version Number**
What database version number should be assigned to this migration? The migration will add significant schema changes including new statistics fields and the isFavorite field.

*Considerations:*
- Current database version (if known)
- Room migration numbering strategy
- Future migration planning

EDNOTE: For simplicity, let's call it version 10.

**Q50: Configuration Page User Access**
Q5 EDNOTE mentions "Add a Configuration button on the Settings page." How exactly should users access this Configuration page?

*Implementation Options:*
- Add button to existing Settings/Profile screen - Yes
- Add menu item to main navigation - No
- Add settings icon in toolbar - No
- How should the button be labeled: "Configuration", "Settings", "Preferences"? - Configuration

**Q51: Performance Measurement Strategy** 
Phase 1 success metrics specify "75% performance improvement for piece-related operations." How should this be measured and validated?

*Measurement Approach:*
- Which specific operations should be benchmarked? (piece list loading, piece statistics queries, suggestions generation)
- Should measurements be done with development tools or in-app timing?
- What baseline measurements should be taken before migration?
- Should performance tests be automated?

EDNOE: Do not measure performance improvement.

**Q52: File Naming Conventions for Import/Export**
What should be the default file naming conventions for JSON exports?

*Proposed Format:*
- `playstreak_export_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.json` - Yes
- Include app version in filename? - No
- Where should files be saved by default (Downloads folder, app-specific directory)? - Yes, downloads folder


**Q53: Piece Name Validation Rules**
Beyond case-insensitive uniqueness, are there any other validation rules for piece names?

*Validation Considerations:*
- Maximum length limits? - Let's make it large 50
- Prohibited characters (special characters, emojis)? - Do not prohibit characters
- Minimum length requirements? - No minimum length
- Trimming whitespace automatically? - yes trim whitespace

**Q54: Activity Level Validation**
The document mentions level 4 for practices and level 3 for performances as "Satisfactory." What are the complete level ranges and validation rules?

*Level System Clarification:*
- Practice levels: 1-4? 1-5?  - practice levels are 1-4
- Performance levels: 1-3? 1-5? - performance levels are 1-3
- Should invalid levels be rejected or clamped to valid range? - Don't worry about this. The user has limited options to select levels
- Are there specific level names/descriptions? - Yes, they are already included in the app

### Final Implementation Edge Cases

**Q55: Migration Dependency Order**
What's the specific order for implementing the database migration to ensure data integrity?

*Proposed Migration Steps:*
1. Create backup of existing database
2. Add new fields to Piece table (all nullable initially)
3. Populate new statistics fields from existing activity data
4. Update piece statistics update logic in application code
5. Test data integrity before marking migration complete

EDNOTE: Yes, do this.

**Q56: Import Validation Error Messages**
What specific error messages should be shown to users for different JSON import validation failures?

*Error Scenarios:*
- Invalid JSON format: "The selected file is not a valid JSON export file"
- Version mismatch: "This export was created with an incompatible app version"
- Missing required fields: "The export file is missing required data fields"
- Data type errors: "The export file contains invalid data formats"
- Piece name conflicts: "A piece with this name already exists: [piece name]"

EDNOTE: Yes, do this

**Q57: Configuration Page Navigation Integration**
How should the Configuration page integrate with the existing app navigation structure?

*Integration Details:*
- Should Configuration be accessible from main navigation menu or only from Settings? - only from settings
- Should there be a back button or up navigation to return to Settings? - Yes
- Should Configuration changes take effect immediately or require saving? - Take effect immediately
- Should there be confirmation dialogs for configuration changes? - No

**Q58: Performance Testing Validation**
Even though Q51 said not to measure performance, how should developers validate that the performance improvements are working?

*Validation Approach:*
- Manual testing with large datasets to ensure responsiveness
- Code review to confirm expensive queries are replaced
- Memory usage monitoring during piece list operations
- User experience testing for perceived performance improvements

EDNOTE: Do not measure performance

**Q59: Data Integrity Recovery Scenarios**
What should happen if piece statistics become inconsistent with activity data during runtime?

*Recovery Options:*
- Automatic detection and logging of inconsistencies
- Manual statistics recalculation option (hidden developer feature)
- Graceful degradation if statistics are missing or invalid
- Clear error reporting to help diagnose issues

EDNOTE: Do not do anything. IN a future dev cycle we will allow users to trim old activity data, and this will cause the piece statistics to not match with the remaining activity data.

### Implementation Completeness & Deployment

**Q60: Testing Strategy & Validation**
The document covers individual component testing but lacks an overall testing approach. What should be the comprehensive testing strategy across all three phases?

*Testing Considerations:*
- Database migration testing with various data scenarios
- Integration testing between activity CRUD operations and statistics updates
- JSON import/export round-trip testing
- User acceptance testing for calendar verbose mode
- Performance regression testing approach
- Should there be automated test cases for critical paths?

EDNOTE: There will be no automated testing. There will be no documented testing approach. I will handle this myself.

**Q61: Release & Deployment Strategy**
How should these changes be rolled out safely to users?

*Deployment Considerations:*
- Should phases be released sequentially or together?
- Beta testing approach with select users
- Rollback plan if critical issues are discovered post-release
- Database migration testing in production-like environment
- App store release notes and change communication

EDNOTE: Do not worry about this.

**Q62: User Communication & Feature Discovery**
How should users be informed about new features, especially the Configuration page and JSON export options?

*Communication Strategy:*
- In-app notifications or tutorials for new features
- Help documentation updates
- Change log or release notes
- Should there be tooltips or guided tours for new functionality?

EDNOTE: DO not worry about this.

**Q63: Success Monitoring & Analytics**
How should the success of these changes be monitored and measured post-implementation?

*Monitoring Approach:*
- Usage analytics for new JSON export feature
- User adoption of verbose calendar mode
- Error tracking for import/export operations
- Performance monitoring of piece-related operations
- User feedback collection mechanisms

EDNOTE: Do not worry about this.

**Q64: Existing Data Validation**
Before implementing the migration, should there be validation of existing data integrity?

*Pre-Migration Validation:*
- Check for orphaned activities without corresponding pieces
- Validate existing piece names for duplicates
- Verify activity level data integrity
- Should inconsistencies be reported or auto-corrected before migration?

EDNOTE: DO not worry about this.

### Additional Clarification Questions

**Q65: Entity File Names vs Table Names**
The document consistently refers to "Piece" entities and "@Entity(tableName = "pieces")", but the current codebase uses "PieceOrTechnique" entities. Should we:
- Create new "Piece" entity files alongside existing "PieceOrTechnique" files, or
- Rename/modify existing "PieceOrTechnique" entities to match the document schema?

*Current Codebase Reality:*
- Existing files use `PieceOrTechnique.kt`, `PieceOrTechniqueDao.kt` 
- Database table name is currently "pieces_techniques"
- All UI code references PieceOrTechnique entities

**RECOMMENDATION:** Keep existing `PieceOrTechnique` entity names and modify them in place. This approach:
- Minimizes code changes across the entire codebase
- Avoids breaking existing references in UI components
- Maintains consistency with established naming patterns
- Reduces risk of introducing bugs from massive refactoring

*Implementation:* Update the document schemas to use `PieceOrTechnique` instead of `Piece` for consistency with reality.

EDNOTE: Go with recommendation

**Q66: Database Table Name Consistency**
The document shows `@Entity(tableName = "pieces")` but asks about modifying files that suggest the current table might be named differently. What should be the actual table name?
- Keep existing table name and update document to match reality, or
- Change table name during migration to match document specification?

**RECOMMENDATION:** Keep the existing table name `"pieces_techniques"` and update the document. This approach:
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing database installations
- Avoids complex table renaming during migration (which can fail)
- Preserves existing database backup/restore compatibility
- Reduces migration complexity and risk

*Implementation:* Update document schemas to show `@Entity(tableName = "pieces_techniques")` to match current reality.
EDNOTE: Go with recommendation

**Q67: Phase Implementation Priority**
Given the complexity revealed through the questions, should the phases be implemented in the documented order (Phase 1, 2, 3) or would a different order be more practical?

*Considerations:*
- Phase 1 requires significant database changes that affect all other features
- Phase 2 JSON export depends on Phase 1 completion
- Phase 3 is relatively independent and could be implemented earlier

**RECOMMENDATION:** Implement in the documented order (Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3). This approach:
- **Phase 1 Foundation**: Database changes provide the performance foundation for all subsequent features
- **Logical Dependencies**: Phase 2 JSON export needs the enhanced piece statistics from Phase 1
- **Risk Management**: Database migration is highest risk and should be completed first
- **User Value**: Performance improvements (Phase 1) provide immediate benefits
- **Testing**: Each phase can be tested independently before moving to the next

*Alternative Consideration:* Phase 3 could be implemented in parallel with Phase 2 since it's independent, but sequential implementation is safer for the single-user scenario.

EDNOTE: Go with recommendation, do not go with the alternative consideration

**Q68: Migration Testing Strategy**
Q55 outlines migration steps, but what specific data scenarios should be tested?

*Test Cases Needed:*
- Empty database (new user)
- Database with pieces but no activities  
- Database with activities but orphaned piece references
- Database with existing favorites data
- Large dataset simulation (hundreds of pieces/activities)

**RECOMMENDATION:** Focus on the three most critical test scenarios given the single-user context:

1. **Current Production Data**: Test migration with the actual user's current database
2. **Empty Database**: Test fresh installation path for new users
3. **Basic Data Set**: Test with a small set of known good data (5-10 pieces, 20-30 activities)

*Implementation Strategy:*
- Create database backup before each test
- Use emulator/test device for migration testing
- Validate data integrity after migration by spot-checking key statistics
- Keep testing lightweight since there's only one production user

*Skip Complex Scenarios:* Given Q60 EDNOTE "I will handle this myself", skip automated testing and complex edge cases.

EDNOTE: No automated testing. I will handle testing myself.

**Q69: Current Database Schema Inspection**
Before implementing the migration, should we first inspect the current database schema to understand exactly what exists today?

*Information Needed:*
- Current table structures and field names
- Existing data types and constraints
- Current database version number
- Any existing migration history

**RECOMMENDATION:** Yes, absolutely inspect the current schema first. This is critical for successful implementation:

*Essential Pre-Implementation Steps:*
1. **Read Current Entity Files**: Examine `PieceOrTechnique.kt`, `Activity.kt` to understand current structure
2. **Check AppDatabase.kt**: Determine current database version and existing migrations
3. **Review DAO Files**: Understand current query patterns that need updating
4. **Identify Gaps**: Compare current schema with proposed schema to plan migration steps

*Implementation Benefits:*
- Prevents migration conflicts and data loss
- Ensures accurate population of new statistics fields
- Identifies any existing features that might break
- Provides baseline for testing migration success

*Priority:* This should be the very first step before any code changes to Phase 1.
EDNOTE: Yes, inspect the schema.

**Q70: Current Schema vs Document Mismatch**
After inspecting the current database schema, I've discovered significant differences between the current implementation and the document specifications:

*Current Implementation Reality:*
- **Entity Name**: `PieceOrTechnique` (not `Piece`)
- **Table Name**: `"pieces_techniques"` (not `"pieces"`)
- **Primary Key**: `Long` (auto-generated) ✓ (matches intent)
- **Current Fields**: `id`, `name`, `type`, `isFavorite` (4 fields)
- **Database Version**: Currently version 1
- **isFavorite**: Already exists in current schema ✓

*Document Specifications:*
- **Entity Name**: `Piece` 
- **Table Name**: `"pieces"`
- **Primary Key**: `Int` (auto-generated)
- **Planned Fields**: 13+ statistics fields to be added
- **Target Database Version**: Version 10 (Q49)

*Critical Questions:*
1. Should we migrate current Long IDs to Int IDs, or keep Long for consistency?
2. Should we rename table from "pieces_techniques" to "pieces" during migration?
3. Current database has NO statistics fields - migration must populate ALL statistics from activities
4. Current `isFavorite` field means we don't need separate favorites table logic

**RECOMMENDATION:** Minimal disruption approach aligned with Q65/Q66 recommendations:
- Keep `PieceOrTechnique` entity name and `"pieces_techniques"` table name
- Keep `Long` IDs for consistency with existing Activity foreign keys
- Add all statistics fields as new columns during migration
- Use existing `isFavorite` field (no migration needed for favorites)


  EDNOTE: Go with recommendation

**Q71: Activity Entity Compatibility**
Current Activity entity uses:
- `pieceOrTechniqueId: Long` - matches current PieceOrTechnique Long IDs
- All required fields exist for statistics calculation
- ActivityType enum has PRACTICE/PERFORMANCE values ✓
- Level field exists for satisfactory calculation ✓

No changes needed to Activity entity for Phase 1 implementation.

**Q72: Database Version Jump Justification**
Current database is version 1, but Q49 specified version 10. Should we:
- Increment to version 2 for this migration (more conventional)
- Use version 10 as planned (larger jump but matches Q49 EDNOTE)

**RECOMMENDATION:** Use version 2 for this migration. The version 10 specification appears arbitrary, and conventional practice is to increment versions sequentially.

EDNOTE: Go with recommendation

**Q73: Statistics Field Population Strategy**
With current schema having NO statistics fields, the migration must calculate ALL statistics from existing activities. For performance, should we:
- Calculate statistics during migration using SQL queries (faster)
- Use application logic to calculate statistics (more reliable)
- Hybrid approach: SQL for counts, application logic for date calculations

**RECOMMENDATION:** Use application logic for reliability. Given single-user scenario, performance of migration is less critical than correctness.

EDNOTE: Go with recommendation

**Q74: Existing Repository Code Impact**
Current `PianoRepository.kt` has methods that will need updating:
- `getFavorites()` - already works with existing `isFavorite` field ✓
- Statistics-related methods will need to be added
- Activity CRUD operations need statistics update logic

Should we implement new statistics methods alongside existing methods or replace existing query-based methods?

**RECOMMENDATION:** Add new statistics-based methods alongside existing ones initially, then gradually replace expensive query-based methods after validation.

EDNOTE: Go with recommendation
