## New Feature Proposals

### 1. Smart Practice Suggestions (Pro Feature)
**Description**: Enhanced practice recommendations using sophisticated local algorithms

**Current Implementation Reality Check:**
PlayStreak currently uses a simple rule-based system:
- Favorites not practiced in 2+ days
- Non-favorites practiced 7-31 days ago
- Fallback to least recently practiced

**Challenges for True AI Implementation:**
1. **Limited Data**: Only tracks date, duration, level, and notes
2. **Local-Only Architecture**: No server infrastructure for ML models
3. **Privacy Constraints**: No aggregated user data for training
4. **Missing Context**: No difficulty ratings, goals, or progression metrics

**Realistic "Smart" Enhancement Approach:**
Rather than claiming "AI-powered" (which would be misleading), implement enhanced algorithms:

```kotlin
// Enhanced suggestion scoring system
- Spaced repetition intervals based on last performance level
- Practice pattern recognition (time of day, day of week)
- Rotating focus areas (technique day, repertoire day)
- Adaptive thresholds based on user's practice frequency
- Performance preparation urgency
- Variety scoring to prevent monotony
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Use weighted scoring algorithm combining multiple factors
- Store pattern data locally using existing Room database
- No external API calls or cloud processing needed
- Market as "Smart Suggestions" not "AI-powered"

**Pro Features:**
- Advanced spaced repetition algorithms
- Custom suggestion weights/preferences
- Practice session recommendations
- Pattern insights dashboard
- Export suggestion analytics

**Monetization**: Strong Pro differentiator without overpromising

## CSV Import Restriction Analysis

Your concern about restricting CSV import to Pro users is **absolutely valid**. Here's why this is problematic:

### Problems with CSV Import Restriction

1. **Data Portability Violation**: Users should be able to import their own data
2. **Switching Barrier**: Prevents users from migrating from other apps
3. **Trust Issue**: Appears anti-consumer and controlling
4. **One-time Use**: Most users import once, poor recurring revenue driver
5. **Workaround Exists**: Tech-savvy users can manually enter data

### Recommended Alternative Approach

**Make CSV Import Free with Pro Enhancements:**

**Free Import Features:**
- Basic CSV import (up to 1000 activities)
- Replace-only mode (current behavior)
- One import per month
- Local files only

**Pro Import Enhancements:**
- Unlimited import size
- Merge mode (add to existing data)
- Unlimited import frequency
- Cloud storage import
- Import preview and validation
- Undo/rollback capability

This approach:
- Respects user data ownership
- Provides genuine Pro value
- Avoids negative perception
- Creates recurring use cases for Pro users who manage multiple devices or need frequent backups

### Detailed CSV Import Differentiation Strategy

**Important Context:** PlayStreak's CSV import/export is designed as a backup/restore feature, not for importing data from other applications. The CSV format is specific to PlayStreak, requiring exact headers and field values. This analysis focuses on enhancing the backup/restore functionality rather than enabling imports from external sources.

**How to meaningfully differentiate CSV import between Free and Pro users:**

#### 1. Import Size and Frequency Limits

**Free Users:**
- Import up to 1,000 activities per file
- Import up to 100 pieces per file
- One import per 30 days
- Single file import only

**Pro Users:**
- Unlimited activities per import
- Unlimited pieces per import
- Unlimited import frequency
- Bulk import multiple files at once

**Rationale**: Most hobbyists importing from another app will have <1000 activities. Professionals and teachers need unlimited imports for multiple students or historical data.

#### 2. Import Behavior and Options

**Free Users:**
- Replace-only import (current behavior)
- Basic import summary
- Standard CSV format only
- Single file import

**Pro Users:**
- Merge option (add to existing data instead of replace)
- Selective import (choose date ranges or pieces)
- Import preview with statistics
- Batch import multiple backup files
- Preserve piece metadata during merge
- Import conflict resolution options

**Rationale**: Pro users may need to combine data from multiple devices or recover partial data without losing current entries.

#### 3. Data Validation and Error Handling

**Free Users:**
- Basic validation (required fields)
- Simple error reporting
- Skip invalid rows
- Summary of imported/skipped rows

**Pro Users:**
- Detailed validation reports
- Line-by-line error details
- Option to fix and retry failed rows
- Export error report for manual fixing
- Continue import despite errors option
- Validation preview before import

**Rationale**: Pro users importing large backup files need detailed feedback to ensure no data is lost.

#### 4. Duplicate Handling

**Free Users:**
- Replace all data (current behavior)
- No duplicate detection needed
- Clean slate approach

**Pro Users:**
- Duplicate detection for merge imports
- Skip or update existing activities
- Piece name matching with normalization
- Activity timestamp comparison
- Choose resolution strategy per conflict

**Rationale**: Pro users merging data from multiple devices need control over how duplicates are handled.

#### 5. Import History and Management

**Free Users:**
- No import history
- Cannot undo imports
- No import analytics

**Pro Users:**
- Complete import history with metadata
- Undo/rollback imports (up to 90 days)
- Import source tracking
- Import analytics (success rates, data quality)
- Re-run previous imports with same settings
- Import audit trail

**Rationale**: Pro users need accountability and ability to correct mistakes.

#### 6. Backup Management Features

**Free Users:**
- Basic import confirmation
- View imported data in app

**Pro Users:**
- Automatic backup before import
- Backup version management
- Schedule automatic exports
- Cloud backup integration
- Compress old backups
- Backup retention policies

**Rationale**: Pro users need robust backup strategies to protect their extensive practice history.

#### 7. Import Convenience Features

**Free Users:**
- Local file selection only
- Manual import process

**Pro Users:**
- Import from cloud storage (Google Drive where backups are stored)
- Drag-and-drop import support
- Recent imports list for re-import
- Import multiple backup files in sequence
- Quick restore from latest backup

**Rationale**: Pro users who backup frequently need convenient ways to restore their data.

#### Implementation Example

**Free User Experience:**
```
1. Click "Import CSV" 
2. Warning: "This will replace all data"
3. Select PlayStreak backup file
4. See summary (X activities, Y pieces)
5. Confirm import
6. Import complete - all data replaced
```

**Pro User Experience:**
```
1. Click "Import Data"
2. Choose import mode: Replace or Merge
3. Select source (local, Google Drive, recent)
4. Preview: X activities, Y pieces, Z potential conflicts
5. For merge: Choose conflict resolution
6. See detailed validation report
7. Confirm import with automatic backup
8. Import complete with detailed summary
9. Option to undo import within 24 hours
```

This differentiation strategy:
- ✅ Respects data ownership (free users can import)
- ✅ Provides substantial Pro value
- ✅ Creates recurring use cases (multiple imports)
- ✅ Scales with user needs
- ✅ Justifies subscription cost
- ✅ Avoids negative perception
